## @PACKAGE@

Package @PACKAGE@-@VERSION@ was released under GPL license @DATE@.

This package provides a number of "C"-language tools for working with
the X Desktop Environment.  Most of these tools were previously written
in perl(1) and were part of the xde-tools package.  They have now been
codified in "C" for speed and to provide access to libraries not
available from perl(1).

Primary tools included are:

 xde-session   - an X session manager for XDE
 xde-chooser   - an X session (window manager) chooser for XDE
 xde-input     - an X11 input settings tracker for XDE
 xde-xchooser  - an X11 XDMCP chooser for XDE
 xde-logout    - an X session logout facility
 xde-autostart - an XDG autostart utility
 xde-xsession  - an X session launcher facility
 xde-wmproxy   - an X Session Management proxy for window managers
 xde-xlogin    - an X11 XDMCP greeter for XDE
 xde-xlock     - an X screen locker
