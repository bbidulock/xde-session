@PACKAGE@
===============

Package `@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@` was released under GPLv3 license
@DATE@.

This package provides a number of "C"-language tools for working with
the _X Desktop Environment_.  Most of these tools were previously
written in `perl(1)` and were part of the `xde-tools` package.  They
have now been codified in "C" for speed and to provide access to
libraries not available from `perl(1)`.

Primary tools included are:

 - __`xde-session`__   -- an X session manager for XDE
 - __`xde-chooser`__   -- an X session (window manager) chooser for XDE
 - __`xde-input`__     -- an X11 input settings tracker for XDE
 - __`xde-xchooser`__  -- an X11 XDMCP chooser for XDE
 - __`xde-logout`__    -- an X session logout facility
 - __`xde-autostart`__ -- an XDG autostart utility
 - __`xde-xsession`__  -- an X session launcher facility
 - __`xde-wmproxy`__   -- an X Session Management proxy for window managers
 - __`xde-xlogin`__    -- an X11 XDMCP greeter for XDE
 - __`xde-xlock`__     -- an X screen locker
