[xde-session -- release notes.  2018-10-06]: #

Pre-Release 1.9
===============

This is another pre-release of the xde-session package.  It includes the
playing of sound effects when locking and unlocking the screen.  Also, window
manager launch scripts now turn the NumLock key off before launching the
window manager.  (Some window managers defeat some mouse actions and key
bindings when the NumLock key is on.)

As usual, included is an autoconf tarball for building the package from
source.  Please report problems to the issues list on github.
