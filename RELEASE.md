autoupdate to configure.ac, prepares to use json-c for some porgrams,
updates the adwm keysrc and buttonrc files.  The next release may
include a working xde-xlogin program.

As usual, included in the release is an autoconf tarball for building
the package from source.  See the [NEWS](NEWS) and [TODO](TODO) file in
the release for more information.  Please report problems to the issues
