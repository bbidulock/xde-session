xde-session -- TODO file.  2016-06-16

* [ ] do not autostart tray icons; make an xde-trayicons instead (or
      maybe just use xde-tray) that is autostarted, but which will only
      launch the tray icons requested by the user (or default to a
      reasonable set, based on profile).

* [ ] Expect system tray .desktop files to be in the XDG subdirectory
      $XDG_DATA_DIRS/trayicons.  Also consider .desktop files with the
      Category of TrayIcon in $XDG_DATA_DIRS/applications.

* [ ] xde-tray (or xde-trayicons) should also monitor the system tray
      and add to configuration tray icons that are launched separately
      after startup.  Should also do X11 Session Management for the
      system tray and icons.

* [ ] do not autostart dock apps; make an xde-dockapps instead (or maybe
      just use xde-dock) that is autostarted, but which will only launch
      the dock apps requested by the user (or default to a reasonable
      set, based on profile).

* [ ] Expect dock app .desktop files to be in the XDG subdirectory
      $XDG_DATA_DIRS/dockapps.  Also consider .desktop files with the
      Category of DockApp in $XDG_DATA_DIRS/applications.

* [ ] xde-dock (or xde-dockapps) should also monitor the dock and add to
      configuration dock apps that are launched separately after
      startup.  Should also do X11 Session Management for the dock and
      dock apps.

* [ ] xde-xlock should read DPMS timeouts and give the user the option
      to lock the screen at any of the given levels.

Todo items for xde-xchooser, xde-xlogin, xde-xgreeter:

* [ ] Print error messages from PAM login in the status area.

* [ ] Detect and indicate whether capslock and numlock (even scrolllock)
      keys are in effect with icons beside the password input window.

* [ ] Detect and clear capslock and numlock (even scrolllock) keys when
      starting up.

* [ ] Accept some "special" usernames like slim does (e.g. "reboot").
      Require root password for these user names.

* [ ] These programs need to apply styles and themes from the resource
      database instead of using ~/.gtkrc-2.0{,.xde} like other programs
      in this suite that run after the user has logged in (especially
      xde-xlock).  This needs to be done at startup still.
