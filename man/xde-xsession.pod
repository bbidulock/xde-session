=head1 NAME

xde-xsession - launch an xsession

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<xde-xsession> [I<OPTIONS>] [I<SESSION>|I<SPECIAL>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<xde-xsession> is a C<C>-language program that can be launched from, or
in lieue of, F<~/.xinitrc> or F<~/.xsession> to choose, launch and
manage an X session, or when already running to switch or control the X
session.  It has the following features:

=over

=item 1.

Integrated session management including X session L<xinit(1)>/L<xdm(8)>
and window manager configuration setup for a wide range of known window
managers.

=item 2.

Integrated X11R6 X Session Mangement with full XSM window manager
assistance.

=item 3.

Integrated screen locker and user management (switch user) with
L<systemd(1)> integration.

=item 4.

Integrated XDG Autostart and Application launcher with full startup
notification assistance.

=item 5.

Integrated XINPUT and XSETTINGS management.

=item 6.

Full desktop theme support for a wide range of supported window managers
and support for desktop themes for unsupported window managers
conforming to EWMH/NetWM, GNOME/WinWM, OSF/Motif or WindowMaker
compliant window managers.

=item 7.

Window manager root menu and panel menu setup support.

=item 8.

The Kitchen Sink.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

B<xde-xsession> accepts one optional argument as follows:

=over

=item I<SESSION>

Launch the session, I<SESSION>, where I<SESSION> specifies the X session
identifier of an XDG desktop session to launch.  The X session
identifier, I<SESSION>, can be one of the following:

=over

=item 1.

the name of a desktop entry file without the F<.desktop> suffix (e.g.
C<fluxbox>); the name may contain a "/" if it is specified relative to a
user or system xsession directory, in which case it must not start with
a C</> or C<.>;

=item 2.

the name of a desktop entry file with the F<.desktop> suffix (e.g.
C<fluxbox.desktop>); the same restrictions as (1), above, apply; or,

=item 3.

the full path (absolute or relative) and filename of a desktop entry
file  (e.g. F</usr/share/xsession/fluxbox.desktop>); the full path must
contain at least one C</> and start with either a C</> or a C<.>.

=back

=item I<SPECIAL>

A special XDG session name.  This can by one of the following special
session names:

=over

=item C<default>

Do not choose a session, but simply run (typically without prompting)
whichever session the user has set as a default.  (The default is
located in the file F<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xde/default>).  When no default
is configured, or when the configured default is not usable (e.g.
missing executable), this argument has the same effect as C<choose>.

=item C<current>

Do not choose a session, but simply run (typically without prompting)
whichever session the user last ran.  (When no session is running, the
default is located in the file F<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xde/current>).  When
no current session is configured, or when the last run session is not
usable (e.g. missing executable), this argument has the same effect as
C<choose>.

=item C<choose>

Launch a dialog to choose the session regardless of whether a default
session is configured or available.  This is the most typical mode of
B<xde-xsession>.

=item C<logout>

Do not choose a session but logout an existing session or simply logout
if no session exists.

=item C<manage>

Launch a dialog to perform session management on an existing session.

=back

When unspecified and the B<--xinit> flag is specified, the default is
C<default>; otherwise, the default is C<current>.

=head1 OPTIONS

B<xde-xsession> uses L<getopt_long_only(3)> to parse options, so
abbreviated or single-dash long options are recognized when not
ambiguous.  B<xde-xsession> accepts the following options:

=head2 COMMAND OPTIONS

The following command options are mutually exclusive: the first option
in this group encountered sets the mode of the program.  It is an error
to specify more than one command option.  When no command option is
specified, the program operates as though the B<--launch> option was
specified.

=over

=item [B<--launch>]

Launch the session as specified by I<SESSION>.  If there is an existing
session, this command option (or default action) has the same effect as
specifying B<--choose>.

=item B<--choose>

Ask an existing session to provide a chooser dialog.  See also,
L<xde-chooser(1)>.  This is also the default when B<xde-xsession> is
called with a base C<argv[0]> of F<xde-chooser>.

This option can be used with a I<SESSION> argument to directly launch a
new X session (window manager) from within an existing X session.  The
command will detect whether it was launched directly from within a
window manager root menu I<replace> option (where the window manager
process performs an C<exec> to the new window manager: i.e. the PID of
the replacement X session is the PID of the old X sesssion) and do the
right thing.

=item B<--logout>

Ask an existing session to provide a logout dialog.  See also,
L<xde-logout(1)>.  This is also the default when B<xde-xsession> is
called with a base C<argv[0]> of F<xde-logout>.

This option can be used from inside of the X session to logout of the
session, perform session management, perform power or reboot management,
or choose another window manager.

=item B<--manage>

Ask an existing session to provide a manager dialog.  See also,
L<xde-manager(1)>.  This is also the default when B<xde-xsession> is
called with a base C<argv[0]> of F<xde-manager>.

=item B<--help>, B<-h>

Print usage information to standard error containing current defaults
and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Print the program version to standard output and exit.

=item B<--copying>, B<-C>

Print copying permissions to standard output and exit.

=back

=head2 SESSION OPTIONS

The following session options can be used with most of the command
options listed above.  Almost all options can be specified in the
configuration file or have defaults that can be obtained from the
C<XSession> desktop entry file.

=over

=item B<--xinit>, B<-0>

Launch the session as specified by I<SESSION> after performing normal
F<~/.xinitrc> or F<~/.xsession> intializations.  If there is an existing
session, this command option will fail.

This option may be used directly from, or in lieue of, an F<~/.xinitrc>
or F<~/.xsession> file or can be called directly from
F</etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc> or F</exc/X11/xdm/Xsession> scripts.

=item B<--noask, -N>

=item B<--default>

When a I<SESSION> argument is specified, also set the future default to
I<SESSION>.

=item B<--prompt>

Prompt the user for the session regardless of the value of the
I<SESSION> argument.

=item B<--timeout>, B<-T> I<SECONDS>

Specify the timeout in seconds that the program will wait for user
input before proceeding with the default session.  Set to zero to defeat
the timeout altogether.  The default is 15 seconds.  This option is
useful when you have multiple monitors and the B<xde-xsession> chooser
window winds up on a monitor that is not visible to the user.  (At least
some X session will be invoked that will hopefully utilize all
monitors.)

=item B<--display>, B<-d> I<DISPLAY>

Specify the display to use.  This is not normally necessary as the
display is obtained from the B<DISPLAY> environment variable when this
option is not specified.

=item B<--rcfile>, B<-r> I<CONFIG>

=item B<--desktop>, B<-e> I<DESKTOP>

Specify the desktop environment (DE) to use, I<DESKTOP>, e.g. C<ADWM>,
C<BLACKBOX>, C<ICEWM>, C<FLUXBOX>.  The default value when not specified
is C<XDE>.  The desktop environment must be specified when
B<--autostart> is specified.

In L<lxsession(1)> compatibility mode, this is equivalent to the B<-e>
option to L<lxsession(1)>.  This option may also be specified using the
B<XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP> or B<FBXDG_DE> environment variables described in
L</ENVIRONMENT>, below.

=item B<--session>, B<-s> I<PROFILE>

Invokes L<lxsession(1)> compatibility mode, and specifies the session
profile to use for emulating L<lxsession(1)>.  This is equivalent to the
B<-s> option to L<lxsession(1)>.  This option may also be specified
using the B<DESKTOP_SESSION> environment variable described in
L</ENVIRONMENT>, below.

=item B<--startwm>, B<-m> I<EXECUTE>

Execute the command string, I<EXECUTE>, to start a window manager.
Shell characters will be interpreted.  When specified, the window
manager will be started before all other tasks.

When not specified, this option will be determined from the
F<session.conf> file in the F<SESSION> subdirectory under
C<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xde-xsession>, where I<SESSION> is specified by the
B<-s> option, or by the first non-option argument.

In L<lxsession(1)> compatibility mode, this option will be determined
from the L<lxsession(1)> F<desktop.conf> file in the I<SESSION>
subdirectory under F<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lxsession>, where I<SESSION> is
specified with the B<-s> option.

=item B<--setup>, B<-I> I<COMMAND>

Execute the command string, I<COMMAND>, to set up the window manager
before it is invoked.  This option defaults to executing the shell setup
program in F<$XDG_CONFIG_{HOME,DIRS}/\LDESKTOP\E/setup.sh> if such a
shell file exists.  The option may be repeated to execute a numer of
commands in the order specified.  These commands are executed in the
foreground, one after the other, before the window manager or any other
task is started.  The session will die if any of these commands exit
with a non-zero exit status or terminate on a signal.

This option can be repeated and the commands will be executed in the
order that they were specified.

=item B<--wmname> I<WMNAME>

Specifies the name of the window manager executable.

When setting up the session, unless B<--setup> option is specified, this
name is used to look in configuration directories for an executable file
named F<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME:$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/$WMNAME/setup.sh>.  If one
exists and is executable, it is run as the setup script.

When starting the window manager, unless the B<--startwm> option is
specified, this name is used to look in configuration directories for an
executable file named F<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME:$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/$WMNAME/start.sh>.
If one exists and is executable, it is run instead of the window
manager.  If the start shell script does not exists or is not
executable, I<WMNAME>, is simply executed with no arguments.  If you
wish to pass arguments to the program, use the B<--startwm> option.

=item B<--file>, B<-f> I<FILE>

Execute the commands contained in the file, I<FILE>, after executing the
window manager, but before executing any other commands or autostarting
tasks.  File is compatible with L<lxsession(1)> F<autostart> file.  Each
line of the file contains a shell command to execute, optionally
prefixed with a C<@> to indicate that the process should be restarted
when it exits abnormally.  Tasks executed from this file will be started
before any specified by the B<-x> option, or auto-started from XDG
autostart desktop files.

In L<lxsession(1)> compatibility mode, this option will default to the
F<autostart> file in the I<SESSION> subdirectory under
F<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lxsession>, where I<SESSION> is specified with the
B<-s> option.

=item B<--exec>, B<-x> I<COMMAND>

Execute the command string, I<COMMAND>, to start applications after the
window manager, and before autostart tasks are executed.  This option
defaults to none.  The option may be repeated to execute a number of
commands in the order specified.  It is possible to prefix the
I<COMMAND> string with a single C<@> that will indicate that the task
should be restarted when it exits abnormally.

This option can be repeated and the commands will be executed in order.

=item B<--noautostart>, B<-a> | B<--autostart>

Specifies whether (or not) to autostart XDG applications in accordance
with the L<Desktop Application Autostart Specification>.  (The inverted
sense of the B<-a> flag is for compatibility with L<lxsession(1)>.)
The default is to autostart XDG applications.

=item B<--autowait>, B<--no-autowait>

Normally, when B<xde-xsession> is executing an autostart entry, it will
determine whether the application needs to wait for resources or a
startup phase before launching the application.  This option requests
that B<xde-xsession> wait (or not wait) for any resources or startup
phase.  See L</Autostart>, below.

Note that when B<--noautostart>, these options have no effect because
applications are then not autostarted at all.

=item B<--wait>, B<-w> | B<--nowait>

Specifies whether (or not) to wait for a window manager to take control
of the root window of the default screen of the display before starting
further applications.  This option takes effect regardless of whether
the B<--startwm> option has been specified.

=item B<--pause>, B<-p> [I<PAUSE>]

Specifies the interval of time, I<PAUSE>, in seconds to wait after the
window manager initialization phase before starting the first
applications.  If I<PAUSE> is not specified, it defaults to 2 seconds.
The default when the option is not specified is not to pause at all.
The pause can be explicitly disable by using a I<PAUSE> value of zero
(0).

=item B<--toolwait>, B<-W> [I<GUARD>][:I<DELAY>]

When auto-starting tasks for which startup notification completion can be
determined, serialize the startup in a similar fashion to
L<xtoolwait(1)>, where the next autostart task is not launched until the
previous task is complete, or the guard timeout period, I<GUARD>, in
milliseconds, expires.  Where startup notification completion cannot be
determined (such as for command executed from the B<--file> or B<--exec>
options), the program will wait I<DELAY> milliseconds before starting the
next task.  I<GUARD> defaults to 200 milliseconds.  I<DELAY> defaults to
zero (0) milliseconds.  The default is to perform tool wait.  To disable
tool wait, specify C<--toolwait 0:0>.

=item B<--charset>, B<-c> I<CHARSET>

Specify the character set with which to output the XDG desktop file
derived information.  Defaults to the character set (C<LC_CHARSET>) in
use by the current locale.  Because the program is intended on running
after login, use of this option is seldom necessary, and its use is
deprecated.

=item B<--language>, B<-L> I<LANGUAGE>

Specify the output language for XDG desktop file derived information.
Defaults to the language (C<LC_MESSAGES>) of the current locale.
Because the program is intended on running after login, use of this
option is seldom necessary, and its use is deprecated.

=item B<--vendor>, B<-O> I<VENDOR>

Specifies the vendor name for branding and custom configuration.  The
default when unspecified is C<unexicon>.  Use a null string to defeat
branding.  Specifying or defaulting I<VENDOR> causes F</etc/xdg/$VENDOR>
to be prefixed to C<$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS> and F</usr/share/$VENDOR> to be
prefixed to C<$XDG_DATA_DIRS>.

Also, if the C<$XDG_MENU_PREFIX> environment variable is not set up, it
will be set to I<VENDOR> with a C<-> appended.

(Note that, regardless of vendor setting, F</etc/xdg/xde> is always
prefixed to C<$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS> and F</usr/share/xde> is always prefixed
to C<$XDG_DATA_DIRS>.)

=item B<--splash>, B<-l> [I<IMAGE>] | B<--nosplash>

Specifies that a splash window is to be generated and optionally
populated with an image from the file, I<IMAGE>, (that can be in XPM or
PNG format).  The splash window will display the icons of the XDG
compliant F<*.desktop> files, and restored session managed applications,
as they are started.  The I<IMAGE> is for optional branding.

=item B<--banner>, B<-b> I<BANNER>

Specifies a custom splash login logo.  When unspecified, B<xde-xsession> 
will use a branded logo that depends on environment variables.  This
option is compatible with other tools (L<xde-chooser(1)> and
L<xde-logout(1)>) and is an alternate way of specifying the I<IMAGE>
argument to the B<--splash> option.

=item B<--message>, B<-g> I<MESSAGE>

=item B<--side>, B<-S> {B<left>|B<top>|B<right>|B<bottom>}

Specifies the side of the window on which the logo will be placed.  This
option is recognized for compatibility with L<lxsession-logout(1)>.
B<xde-logout> always places the logo on the left and this option is
ignored.

=item B<--mkdirs>, B<--nomkdirs>

Make (or not) missing user directories.  User directories that will be
created are F<$HOME/Desktop>, F<$HOME/Downloads>, F<$HOME/Templates>,
F<$HOME/Public>, F<$HOME/Documents>, F<$HOME/Documents/Music>,
F<$HOME/Documents/Pictures>, F<$HOME/Documents/Videos>.

(Note that, on Arch Linux, user directories are normally updated by the
F<xdg-user-dirs-update> L<systemd(1)> service.)

=item B<--icons>, B<-i> I<THEME>

Specifies the icon theme to use.  Otherwise, the user's default GTK+
icon theme will be used (i.e. from F<$HOME/.gtkrc-2.0>; but note the
B<--xde-theme> option as well.)

=item B<--theme>, B<-t> I<THEME>

Specifes the GTK+ theme to use.  Otherwise, the user's default GTK+
theme will be used (i.e. from F<$HOME/.gtkrc-2.0>); but note the
B<--xde-theme> option as well.)

=item B<--cursors>, B<-z> I<THEME>

Specifies the cursor theme to use.  Otherwise, the user's default cursor
theme will be used (i.e. from F<$HOME/.gtkrc-2.0>; but note the
B<--xde-theme> option as well.)

=item B<--xde-theme>, B<-X>

Use the current XDE desktop theme for the splash window instead of the
specified or default GTK+ theme.

=item B<--charset, -c> I<CHARSET>

=item B<--language, -L> I<LANGUAGE>

=back

=head2 GENERAL OPTIONS

=cut

=item B<--foreground>, B<-F>

The default is for the program to daemonize itself and continue
monitoring auto-started tasks in the background.  This option causes the
program to run in the foreground and prints debugging information to
standard error.  Implies a debug level of 2.

=item B<--dry-run>, B<-n>

Do not do anything (do not execute or write out files), just print to
standard error what would be done.  Implies a debug level of 2.  Useful
with B<--foreground>.

=item B<--debug>, B<-D> [I<LEVEL>]

Increment or set the debug level to I<LEVEL>.  The default debugging
level is 0 (meaning no debugging).  When set, the program will print
debugging information to standard error during operation.

(Note that because this option takes an optional argument, C<--> must be
specified before any non-option argument.)

=item B<--verbose>, B<-v> [I<LEVEL>]

Increment or set the output verbosity level to I<LEVEL>.  THe default
output verbosity level is 1.

(Note that because this option takes an optional argument, C<--> must be
specified before any non-option argument.)

=back

=head1 USAGE

B<xde-xsession> replaces the functionality of a suite of XDE
applications, as follows:

=over

=item L<xde-chooser(1)>

B<xde-xsession> replaces L<xde-chooser(1)> by providing a similar choice
of available XSession, but with consideration for save X11R6 Session
Management sessions.

=item L<xde-session(1)> and/or L<xdg-xsession(1)>

=item L<xde-autostart(1)> and/or L<xdg-autostart(1)>

=item L<xde-xlock(1)>

=item L<xde-logout(1)>

=back

=head1 BEHAVIOR

=head2 Session Management

=head2 X11R6 Session Management

=head2 Autostart

Note that some key fields in the F<.desktop> file of an application can
specify the autostart phase (e.g. C<AutostartPhase>,
C<X-GNOME-Autostart-Phase>).  When the B<--no-autostart> option is not
specified, the setting of these key fields may affect the default
settings of the session options.  In particular:

=over

=item C<Initialization>

When an autostart phase of C<Initialization> is specified,
B<xde-xsession> will not wait for any desktop resource before running
the application or command.

=item C<WindowManager>

When an autostart phase of C<WindowManager> is specified,
B<xde-xsession> will not wait for any desktop resource before running
the application or command.

=item C<Panel>

When an autostart phase of C<PaneL> is specified, B<xde-xsession> will
wait for a window manager before continuing; however, it will not wait
for a tray or pager.  It will only wait for a composite manager if one
is expected.

=item C<Desktop>

When an autostart phase of C<Desktop> is specified, B<xde-xsession> will
wait for a window manager before continuing.  It will only await other
resources if they have been explicitly specified otherwise.

=item C<Applications>

When an autostart phase of C<Desktop> is specified, or when no autostart
phase is specified, B<xde-xsession> will wait for a window manager
before continuing; however, it will only await other resources if they
have been explicitly specified otherwise.

=back

When the C<AutostartPhase> is not specified, B<xde-xsession> may use the
category in the F<.desktop> file of an application to determine the
autostart phase in whcih the application should be launched, as follows:

=over

=item C<DockApp>

Applications in this category will be launched in the
C<Applications> phase.  It might be a good idea to wait for a C<Dock> or
a window manager supporting a dock before autostarting these
applications.

=item C<TrayIcon>

Applications in this category will be launched in the
C<Applications> phase, and will wait for a system tray to appear before
launching.

=item C<Audio>

Applications in this category will wait for an audio server to appear.

=item C<SystemTray>

Applications in this category will not wait for a system tray: the
application provides one.

=item C<Pager>

Applications in this category will not wait for a desktop pager: the
application provides one.

=item C<Panel>

Applications in this category will not wait for a system tray nor a
desktop pager: most panels provide these.

=head1 FILES

=head2 AUTOSTART DESKTOP ENTRY FILE

B<xde-xsession> reads the B<AutoStart> formatted F<.desktop> file in the
F<autostart> subdirectory of each use and system XDG configuration directory.
Normal XDG precedence rules apply for F<.desktop> files in these
directories.

B<xde-xsession> recognizes the key-value pairs in the C<Desktop Entry>
group in the file.  It also recognizes the following GNOME-defined keys:

=over

=item B<X-GNOME-AutoRestart>=I<BOOLEAN>

This is the name that is put on the window manager check window.  That
is, the B<_NET_WM_NAME> property on the B<_NET_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK>
window.

=item B<X-GNOME-WMSettingsModule>=I<STRING>

=back

=head2 XSESSION DESKTOP ENTRY FILE

B<xde-xsession> reads the B<XSession> formatted F<.desktop> files in the
F<xsessions> subdirectory of each user and system XDG data directory.
Normal XDG precedence rules apply for F<.desktop> files in these
directories.

B<xde-xsession> recognizes the key-value pairs in the C<Desktop Entry>
group in the file.  It also recognizes the GNOME-defined keys described
under L</AUTOSTART DESKTOP ENTRY FILE>, above.

It also recognizes key-value pairs in any C<XDE Session> group found in
the file as described under L</CONFIGURATION FILE>, below.

B<xde-xsession> also recognizes key-value pairs in any C<Window Manager>
group found in the file roughly the same way as GNOME did as follows:

=over

=item B<SessionManaged>=I<BOOLEAN>

=item B<StartupNotification>=I<BOOLEAN>


=back

=head2 CONFIGURATION FILE

The B<xde-xsession> configuration file is an F<.ini> style key-value
file.  The file is located in XDG user and system configuration
directories under the path F<xde/$PROFILE/xsession.ini>, where $PROFILE
is the value passed with the B<--session> option, or when no such file
is found, a file located under the path F<xde/default/xsession.ini>.

The normal XDG directory rules are used for locating the configuration
file.  If no configuration file can be found B<xde-xsession> uses
compiled configuration defaults.

When the program goes to launch an XSession, it may also use the
settings provided in XSession desktop file.

In either file, the program recognizes key-value pairs contained in one
group named C<XDE Session>.

For the key-value pairs described below, a I<PATH> value can be a null,
partial, absolute tilde-expanded or relative path.  Null paths disable
the feature with which they are associated.  Partial paths are paths
that do not begin with a tilde (C<~>), slash (C</>) or dot (C<.>), but
may contain a slash (C</>).  Partial paths are looked up relative to XDG
user and system configuration directories using the normal XDG directory
precedence rules.  Absolute paths begin with either a tilde (C<~>) or a
slash (C</>) where the tilde (C<~>) will be replaced with the user's
B<HOME> directory.  Relative paths must begin with a dot (C<.>) and are
looked up relative to the current directory at the time that
B<xde-xsession> was invoked (normally the user's home directory).

The following keys are recognized:

=over

=item B<DefaultXSession>=I<SESSION>

This key-value pair defines the session that will be used when no
I<SESSION> argument is provided.  Possible values are the same as
described above under L</ARGUMENTS>.

The default when this key is unspecified is C<choose>.

This key cannot reasonably be used from an XSession file.

=item B<Desktop>=I<STRING>

The desktop environment to set in the $XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP environment
variable and to use for autostart and application launching when
examining C<OnlyShowIn> and C<NotShowIn> key-value pairs in desktop
entry files.  Will be overridden by the B<--desktop> command line option.
Can be specified in an XSession file.

=item B<Profile>=I<PROFILE>

=item B<StartupFile>=I<PATH>

Specifies a null, partial, absolute tilde-expanded or relative path to a
file from which to read formatted commands to launch before performing
autostart, but after starting the XSession.  Defaults to an automatic
lookup algorithm.  Will be overridden by the B<--file> command line
option.  Can be specified in an XSession file.

=item B<Wait>=I<BOOLEAN>

Specifies whether (or not) to wait for a window manager to take control
of the root window of the default screen of the display before starting
further applications.  Will be overridden by the B<--wait> command line
option.  Can be specified in an XSession file.

=item B<Pause>=I<SECONDS>

Specifies the interval of time, I<SECONDS>, in seconds, to wait after
the window manager initialization phase before starting the first
applications.  If B<Pause> is not specified, it defaults to 2 seconds.
Will be overriden by the B<--pause> command line option.  Can be
specified in an XSession file.

=item B<ToolWait>=I<BOOLEAN>
