L<systemd(8)> integration.

=item 4.

Integrated XDG Autostart and Application launcher with full startup
notification assistance.

=item 5.

Integrated XINPUT and XSETTINGS management.

=item 6.

Full desktop theme support for a wide range of supported window managers
and support for desktop themes for unsupported window managers
conforming to EWMH/NetWM, GNOME1/WinWM, OSF/Motif or WindowMaker
compliant window managers.

=item 7.

Window manager root menu and panel menu support.

=item 8.

The Kitchen Sink.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

B<xde-xsession> accepts one optional argument as follows:

=over

=item I<SESSION>

Launch the session, I<SESSION>, where I<SESSION> specifies the X session
identifier of an XDG desktop session to launch.  The X session
identifier, I<SESSION>, can be one of the following:

=over

=item 1.

the name of a desktop entry file without the F<.desktop> suffix (e.g.
C<fluxbox>); the name may contain a "/" if it is specified relative to a
user or system xsession directory, in which case it must not start with
a C</> or C<.>;

=item 2.

the name of a desktop entry file with the F<.desktop> suffix (e.g.
C<fluxbox.desktop>); the same restrictions as (1), above, apply; or,

=item 3.

the full path (absolute or relative) and filename of a desktop entry
file  (e.g. F</usr/share/xsession/fluxbox.desktop>); the full path must
contain at least one C</> and start with either a C</> or a C<.>.

=back

=item I<SPECIAL>

A special XDG session name.  This can by one of the following special
session names:

=over

=item C<default>

Do not choose a session, but simply run (typically without prompting)
whichever session the user has set as a default.  (The default is
located in the file F<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xde/default>).  When no default
is configured, or when the configured default is not usable (e.g.
missing executable), this argument has the same effect as C<choose>.

=item C<current>

Do not choose a session, but simply run (typically without prompting)
whichever session the user last ran.  (When no session is running, the
default is located in the file F<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xde/current>).  When
no current session is configured, or when the last run session is not
usable (e.g. missing executable), this argument has the same effect as
C<choose>.

=item C<choose>

Launch a dialog to choose the session regardless of whether a default
session is configured or available.  This is the most typical mode of
B<xde-xsession>.

=item C<logout>

Do not choose a session but logout an existing session or simply logout
if no session exists.

=item C<manage>

Launch a dialog to perform session management on an existing session.

=back

When unspecified and the B<--xinit> flag is specified, the default is
C<default>; otherwise, the default is C<current>.

=head1 OPTIONS

B<xde-xsession> uses L<getopt_long_only(3)> to parse options, so
abbreviated or single-dash long options are recognized when not
ambiguous.  B<xde-xsession> accepts the following options:

=head2 COMMAND OPTIONS

The following command options are mutually exclusive: the first option
in this group encountered sets the mode of the program.  It is an error
to specify more than one command option.  When no command option is
specified, the program operates as though the B<--launch> option was
specified.

=over

=item [B<--launch>]

Launch the session as specified by I<SESSION>.  If there is an existing
session, this command option (or default action) has the same effect as
specifying B<--choose>.

=item B<--xinit>

Launch the session as specified by I<SESSION> after performing normal
F<~/.xinitrc> or F<~/.xsession> intializations.  If there is an existing
session, this command option will fail.

This option may be used directly from, or in lieue of, an F<~/.xinitrc>
or F<~/.xsession> file or can be called directly from
F</etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc> or F</exc/X11/xdm/Xsession> scripts.

=item B<--choose>

Ask an existing session to provide a chooser dialog.  See also,
L<xde-chooser(1)>.  This is also the default when B<xde-xsession> is
called with a base C<argv[0]> of F<xde-chooser>.

This option can be used with a I<SESSION> argument to directly launch a
new X session (window manager) from within an existing X session.  The
command will detect whether it was launched directly from within a
window manager root menu I<replace> option (where the window manager
process performs an C<exec> to the new window manager: i.e. the PID of
the replacement X session is the PID of the old X sesssion) and do the
right thing.

=item B<--logout>

Ask an existing session to provide a logout dialog.  See also,
L<xde-logout(1)>.  This is also the default when B<xde-xsession> is
called with a base C<argv[0]> of F<xde-logout>.

This option can be used from inside of the X session to logout of the
session, perform session management, perform power or reboot management,
or choose another window manager.

=item B<--manage>

Ask an existing session to provide a manager dialog.  See also,
L<xde-manager(1)>.  This is also the default when B<xde-xsession> is
called with a base C<argv[0]> of F<xde-manager>.

=item B<--help>, B<-h>

Print usage information to standard error containing current defaults
and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Print the program version to standard output and exit.

=item B<--copying>, B<-C>

Print copying permissions to standard output and exit.

=back

=head2 GENERAL OPTIONS

The following general options can be used with most of the command
options listed above.  Almost all options can be specified in the
configuration file or have defaults that can be obtained from the
C<XSession> desktop entry file.

=head1 FILES

=head2 AUTOSTART DESKTOP ENTRY FILE

B<xde-session> reads the B<AutoStart> formatted F<.desktop> file in the
F<autostart> subdirectory of each use and system XDG configuration directory.
Normal XDG precedence rules apply for F<.desktop> files in these
directories.

B<xde-session> recognizes the key-value pairs in the C<Desktop Entry>
group in the file.  It also recognizes the following GNOME-defined keys:

=over

=item B<X-GNOME-AutoRestart>=I<BOOLEAN>

=item B<X-GNOME-Autostart-Delay>=I<BOOLEAN>

=item B<X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled>=I<BOOLEAN>

=item B<X-GNOME-Autostart-Notify>=I<BOOLEAN>

=item B<X-GNOME-Autostart-Phase>=I<STRING>

=item I<universal-access>

=item I<user-accounts>

=back

=item B<X-GNOME-UsesNotifications>=I<BOOLEAN>

=item B<X-GNOME-WMName>=I<STRING>

This is the name that is put on the window manager check window.  That
is, the B<_NET_WM_NAME> property on the B<_NET_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK>
window.

=item B<X-GNOME-WMSettingsModule>=I<STRING>

=back

=head2 XSESSION DESKTOP ENTRY FILE

B<xde-xsession> reads the B<XSession> formatted F<.desktop> files in the
F<xsessions> subdirectory of each user and system XDG data directory.
Normal XDG precedence rules apply for F<.desktop> files in these
directories.

B<xde-session> recognizes the key-value pairs in the C<Desktop Entry>
group in the file.  It also recognizes the GNOME-defined keys described
under L</AUTOSTART DESKTOP ENTRY FILE>, above.

It also recognizes key-value pairs in any C<XDE Session> group found in
the file as described under L</CONFIGURATION FILE>, below.

B<xde-session> also recognizes key-value pairs in any C<Window Manager>
group found in the file roughly the same way as GNOME did as follows:

=over

=item B<SessionManaged>=I<BOOLEAN>

=item B<StartupNotification>=I<BOOLEAN>


=back

=head2 CONFIGURATION FILE

The B<xde-xsession> configuration file is an F<.ini> style key-value
file.  The file is located in XDG user and system configuration
directories under the path F<xde/$PROFILE/xsession.ini>, where $PROFILE
is the value passed with the B<--session> option, or when no such file
is found, a file located under the path F<xde/default/xsession.ini>.

The normal XDG directory rules are used for locating the configuration
file.  If no configuration file can be found B<xde-xsession> uses
compiled configuration defaults.

When the program goes to launch an XSession, it may also use the
settings provided in XSession desktop file.

In either file, the program recognizes key-value pairs contained in one
group named C<XDE Session>.

For the key-value pairs described below, a I<PATH> value can be a null,
partial, absolute tilde-expanded or relative path.  Null paths disable
the feature with which they are associated.  Partial paths are paths
that do not begin with a tilde (C<~>), slash (C</>) or dot (C<.>), but
may contain a slash (C</>).  Partial paths are looked up relative to XDG
user and system configuration directories using the normal XDG directory
precedence rules.  Absolute paths begin with either a tilde (C<~>) or a
slash (C</>) where the tilde (C<~>) will be replaced with the user's
B<HOME> directory.  Relative paths must begin with a dot (C<.>) and are
looked up relative to the current directory at the time that
B<xde-xsession> was invoked (normally the user's home directory).

The following keys are recognized:

=over

=item B<DefaultXSession>=I<SESSION>

This key-value pair defines the session that will be used when no
I<SESSION> argument is provided.  Possible values are the same as
described above under L</ARGUMENTS>.

The default when this key is unspecified is C<choose>.

This key cannot reasonably be used from an XSession file.

=item B<Desktop>=I<STRING>

The desktop environment to set in the $XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP environment
variable and to use for autostart and application launching when
examining C<OnlyShowIn> and C<NotShowIn> key-value pairs in desktop

Can be specified in an XSession file.

=item B<Profile>=I<PROFILE>

=item B<StartupFile>=I<PATH>

Specifies a null, partial, absolute tilde-expanded or relative path to a
file from which to read formatted commands to launch before performing
autostart, but after starting the XSession.  Defaults to an automatic

option.  Can be specified in an XSession file.

=item B<Wait>=I<BOOLEAN>

Specifies whether (or not) to wait for a window manager to take control
of the root window of the default screen of the display before starting
further applications.  Will be overridden by the B<--wait> command line
option.  Can be specified in an XSession file.

=item B<Pause>=I<SECONDS>

Specifies the interval of time, I<SECONDS>, in seconds, to wait after
the window manager initialization phase before starting the first
applications.  If B<Pause> is not specified, it defaults to 2 seconds.

specified in an XSession file.

=item B<ToolWait>=I<BOOLEAN>

Specifies whether or not to perform tool wait on auto-started tasks where
startup completion notification can be determined from the
B<StartupNotify> and B<StartupWMClass> key-value pairs in the desktop
entry file for the task.  The default when unspecified is to perform
tool wait.  Can be overridden by the B<--toolwait> command line option.
Not useful in an XSession file.

=item B<ToolWaitGuard>=I<MILLISECONDS>

When tool wait is being performed, only wait I<MILLISECONDS>
milliseconds for startup notification completion before starting the
next task.  The default is 200 milliseconds.  Ignored unless B<ToolWait>

Not useful in an XSession file.

=item B<ToolWaitDelay>=I<MILLISECONDS>

When tool wait is being performed, delay I<MILLISECONDS> milliseconds
after the current task completes startup notification or whose guard
timer expires before starting the next task.  The default is 0
milliseconds.  Ignored unless B<ToolWait> is C<true>.  Can be overridden
by the B<--toolwait> command line option.  Not useful in an XSession
file.

=item B<Language>=I<LANGUAGE>

name converted to all uppercase.  Can be localized according to desktop
entry file rules.  When unspecified, the logout prompt defaults to "Log
out of %p session?"; the chooser prompt defaults to a null string (no
prompt display).  The logout prompt can be overridden by the B<--prompt>
command line argument.  Can be specified (and localized) in an XSession
file.

=item B<ChooserSide>={B<left>|B<top>|B<right>|B<bottom>}
