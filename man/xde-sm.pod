=head1 NAME

xde-sm - XDE Session Manager

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<xde-sm> [I<OPTIONS>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<xde-sm> is an X11 Session Manager.  It is a more beautiful replacement
for the historical L<xsm(1)>.

B<xde-sm> provides a master X11R6 Session Manager.  It is not intended
to be too fancy.  There are eight session management programs in the XDE
suite as follows:

=over

=item 1.

L<xde-sm(1)>:-
Provide support for X11R6 Session Management.

=item 2.

L<xde-chooser(1)>:-

=item 3.

L<xde-smproxy(1)>:-
Provide support for non-session aware applications in the spirit of
L<smproxy(1)>.

=item 4.

L<xde-wmproxy(1)>:-
Provide support for window managers that do not support session
management directly, but which provide some modicum of NetWM/EWMH or
WinWM/WMH support.

=item 5.

L<xde-autostart(1)>:-
Provides support for applications that are automatically launched at
startup (in accordance with XDG specifications).

=item 6.

L<xde-startwm(1)>:-

=item 7.

L<xde-dockmgr(1)>:-
Provides a proxy X11R6 Session Manager for managing L<wmaker(1)> dock
applications.
This proxy manager is responsible for managing L<wmaker(1)> dock
applications, which are typically not session-management-aware.

=item 8.

L<xde-traymgr(1)>:-
Provides a proxy X11R6 Session Manager for managing system tray icons.
This proxy manager is responsible for managing system tray icons, which
sometimes are or are not session-management-aware.

=back

Of these, only B<xde-sm> is necessary.  B<xde-sm> has options that will
perform the functions of other components.  One of the reasons for
integrating functionality into the primary session manager, is that it
is the only session manager with which we can guarantee connectivity
(via the B<SESSION_MANAGER> environment variable set for the entire
session at startup).

=head1 OPTIONS

The program uses L<getopt_long_only(3)> to parse options, so abbreviated
or single-dash long options are recognized when not ambiguous.  The
program accepts the following options:

=head2 COMMAND OPTIONS

Command options affect the major operating mode of the program.  Only
one command option may be specified (with the exception that B<--help>
can be specified in conjunction with any other command option).  When no
command option is specified, B<--startup> is assumed.  The command
options recognized by the program are as follows:

=over

=item [B<--startup>, B<-b>]

Assume normal operation.  Launch window for the user to select from
available saved sessions.  When no saved sessions are available, move
directly to selection of a new X Session.

=item B<--checkpoint>, B<-c>

Ask a running instance of the session manager to checkpoint the session.
This has the same effect as sending the running session manager a
B<SIGUSR1> signal (see L</SIGNALS>).  This is also the default when the
program is run with an C<argv[0]> of C<xde-sm-checkpoint>.

=item B<--shutdown>, B<-q>

Ask a running instance of the session manager to shutdown the session.
This has the same effect as sending the running session manager a
B<SIGTERM> signal (see L</SIGNALS>).  This is also the default when the
program is run with an C<argv[0]> of C<xde-sm-shutdown>.

=item B<--edit>, B<-e>

Ask a running instance of the session manager to launch the session task
editor.  This is also the default when the program is run with an
C<argv[0]> of C<xde-sm-edit>.

=back

=head2 GENERAL OPTIONS

The following general options can be used with most of the command
options listed above:

=over 4

=item B<--display> I<DISPLAY>

Specifies the X display to which  B<xde-sm> is to connect, I<DISPLAY>,
instead of using the value of the B<DISPLAY> environment variable.

=item B<--session> I<SESSION>

Specifies a particular session, I<SESSION>, which to establish, instead
asking the user to select from a menu.  I<SESSION> must be a valid
session name associated with a stored session or a valid special
keyword; otherwise, B<xde-sm> will behave as though no session were
specified.  The following special keywords are recognized:

=over 4

=item C<last>

Restore the last saved session if one exists.  If there is no session
saved for this user, the user is prompted to select a default session
from the menu.

=item C<default>

Restore the session that the user has selected as the default session.
If no default session has been specified by the user, one will be
selected.

=item C<choose>

Provide a menu to choose from the available sessions: saved and default.

=back

=item B<-n>, B<--dry-run>

Don't do anything, just print what would be done on standard error.

=item B<-D>, B<--debug> [I<LEVEL>]

Increase, or set to I<LEVEL>, the debugging verbosity.  The default
debugging verbosity level is zero (0), which means to output no
debugging information.  When non-zero, debugging information will be
printed to standard error.

=item B<-v>, B<--verbose> [I<LEVEL>]

Increase, or set to I<LEVEL>, the output verbosity.  The default output
verbosity level is one (1), which means to output normal information to
standard output.  When set to zero (0), no output will be printed to
standard output. 


=back

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

B<xde-sm> observes the following environment variables:

=over 4

=item B<SM_SAVE_DIR>

When the B<SM_SAVE_DIR> environment variable is defined, it specifies a
directory in which B<xde-sm> will save all its configuration files.
Otherwise, they will be stored in the user's XDG configuration
directory: F<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xde-sm>.

Session aware applications are also encouraged to save their checkpoint
files in the B<SM_SAVE_DIR> directory, although the user should not
depend on this convention.

=back

=head1 SIGNALS

B<xde-sm> responds to the following signals:

=over 4

=item B<SIGTERM>

B<xde-sm> will respond to a B<SIGTERM> signal by performing a shutdown
with the following options: I<fast>, I<no interaction>, I<local>.  This
allows the user's session to be save when the system is being shut down.
It can also be used to perform a remote shutdown of a session.

=item B<SIGUSR1>

B<xde-sm> will respond to a B<SIGUSR1> signal by performing a checkpoint
with the following options: I<no interaction>, I<local>.  This signal
can be used to perform a remote checkpoint of a session.

=back

=head1 BEHAVIOR

When B<xde-sm> starts up, it first checks to see if the user previously
saved any sessions.  If no saved session exist, B<xde-sm> starts up a
set of default applications (as described above in L</CONFIGURATION>),
or presents a menu of optional sessions to start.  If at least one
saved session exists, a session menu is presented.  The B<--session>
option forces the specified session or selection to be loaded, bypassing
the session menu.

=head2 SESSION MENU

The session menu presents the user with a list of session from which to
choose.  The user can change the currently selected session with the
mouse, or by using the up and down arrows on the keyboard.  Note that
sessions that are locked (i.e. running on a different display) can not
be loaded or deleted.

The following operations can be performed from the session menu:

=over 4

=item I<Load Session>

Pressing this button will load the currently selected session.
Alternately, hitting the C<Return> key will also load the currently
selected session, or the user can double-click a session from the list.

=item I<Delete Session>

This operation will delete the currently selected session, along with
all of the application checkpoint files associated with the session.
After pressing this button, the user will be asked to press the button
to confirm the operation.

=item I<Default/Fail Safe>

B<xde-sm> will start up a set of default applications (as described
under L</CONFIGURATION>).  This is useful when the user wants to start a
fresh session, or if the session configuration files were corrupted and
the user wants a "fail safe" session.

=item I<Cancel>

Pressing this button will cause B<xde-sm> to exit.

=back

=head2 CONTROLLING A SESSION

After B<xde-sm> determines which session to load, it brings up its main
window, then starts up all applications that are part of the session.
The title bar for the session manager's main window will contain the
name of the session that was loaded.

The following options are available from B<xde-sm>'s main window:

=over 4

=item I<Client List>

Pressing this button brings up a window containing a list of all clients
that are in the current session.  For each client, the host machine that
the client is running on is presented.  As clients are added and removed
from the session, this list is updated to reflect the changes.  The user
is able to control how these clients are restarted (see below).

By pressing the I<View Properties> button, the user can view the session
management properties associated with the currently selected client.

By pressing the I<Clone> button, the user can start a copy of the
selected application.

By pressing the I<Kill Client> button, the user can remove a client from
the session.

By selecting a restart hint from the I<Restart Hint> menu, the user can
control the restarting of a client.  The following hits are available:

=over 4

=item B<Restart If Running>

This indicates that the client should be restarted in the next session
when it is connected to the session manager at the end of the current
session. 

=item B<Restart Anyway>

This indicates that the client should be restarted in the next session
even when it exits before the current session is terminated.

=item B<Restart Immediately>

This hint is similar to the B<Restart Anyway> hint, but also the client
is meant to run continuously.  If the client exits, the session manager
will try to restart it in the current session.

=item B<Restart Never>

This hint indicates that the client should not be restarted in the next
session.

=back

Note that all X applications may not be "session aware".  Applications
that are not session aware are ones that do not support the X Session
Management Protocol or they can not be detected by the Session
Management Proxy (see L</PROXY>).  B<xde-sm> allows the user to
manually add such applications to the session.  The bottom of the
B<Client List> window contains a text entry field in which application
commands can by typed.  Each command should go on its own line.  This
information will be saved with the session at checkpoint or shutdown
time.  When the session is restarted, B<xde-sm> will restart these
applications as well as the regular "session aware" applications.

=item I<Session Log>

The session log window presents useful information about the session.
For example, when a session is restarted, all of the restart commands
will be display in the log window.

=item I<Checkpoint>

By performing a checkpoint, all applications that are in the session are
asked to save their state.  Not every application will save its complete
state, but at a minimum, the session manager is guaranteed that it will
receive the command required to restart the application (along with all
command line options).  A window manager participating in the session
should guarantee that the applications will come back up with the same
window configurations.

If the session for checkpoint was never assigned a name, the user will
be required to specify a session name.  Otherwise, the user can perform
the checkpoint using the current session name, or a new session name can
be specified.  If the session name specified already exists, the user
will be given the opportunity to specify a different name or to
overwrite the already existing session.  Note that a session which is
locked can not be overwritten.

While performing a checkpoint, the user must specify the B<Save Type>
which informs the application in the session how much state they should
save:

=over 4

=item B<Local>

This type indicates that the application should save enough infomration
to restore the state as seen by the user.  It should not affect the
state as seen by other users.  For example, an editor would create a
temporary file containing the contents of its editing buffer, the
location of the cursor, etc.

=item B<Global>

This type indicates that the application should commit all of its data
to permanent, globally accessible storage.  For example, the editor
would simply save the edited file name.

=item B<Both>

This type indicates that the application should do both of these.  For
example, the editor would save the edited file, then create a temporary
file with information such as the location of the cursor, etc.

=back

As well as the B<Save Type>, the user may specify the B<Interact Style>:

=over 4

=item B<None>

This style indicates that the application should not interact with the
user while saving state.

=item B<Errors>

This style indicates that the application may interact with the user
only if an error condition arises.

=item B<Any>

This style indicates that the application may interact with the user for
any purpose.  Note that B<xde-sm> will only allow one application to
interact with the user at a time.

=back

After the checkpoint is completed, B<xde-sm> will, if necessary, display
a window containing the list of applications that did not report a
successful save of state.

=item I<Shutdown>

A shutdown provides all of the options found in a checkpoint, but also
can cause the session to exit.  Note that if the interaction style is
B<Errors> or B<Any>, the user may cancel the shutdown.  The user may
cancel the shutdown if any of the applications report an unsuccessful
save of state.

The user may choose to shutdown the session without performing a
checkpoint.

=back

=head2 PROXY

As not all applications have been ported to support the X Session
Management Protocol, a proxy service exists to allow "old" clients to
work with the session manager.  For the proxy to detect an application
joining a session, one of the following must be true:

=over 4

=item 1.

The application maps a top-level window containing the
B<WM_CLIENT_LEADER> property.  This property provides a pointer to the
client leader window that contains the B<WM_CLASS>, B<WM_NAME>,
B<WM_COMMAND> and B<WM_CLIENT_MACHINE> properties.

=item 2.

The application maps a top-level window that does not contain the
B<WM_CLIENT_LEADER> property.  However, this top-level window contains
the B<WM_CLASS>, B<WM_NAME>, B<WM_COMMAND>, and B<WM_CLIENT_MACHINE>
properties.

=back

An application that supports the B<WM_SAVE_YOURSELF> protocol will
receive a B<WM_SAVE_YOURSELF> client message each time the session
manager issues a checkpoint or shutdown.  This allows the application to
save state.  If an application does not support the B<WM_SAVE_YOURSELF>
protocol, then the proxy will provide enough information to the session
manager to restart the application (using B<WM_COMMAND>), but no state
will be restored.

=head2 REMOTE APPLICATIONS

B<xde-sm> requires a remote execution protocol to restart applications
on remote machines.  Currently, B<xde-sm> supports the L<ssh(1)>
protocol.  To restart an application on remote machine X, machine X must
have L<sshd(1)> installed.

=head2 SYSTEMD INTEGRATION

B<xde-sm> monitors the system bus for messages from L<systemd(1)>.  When
actions are detected, the behavior is as follows;

=over

=item Suspend

When the system is suspending, B<xde-sm> checkpoints the system before
allowing the suspend to proceed.  This is in case the system does not
resume from suspend.

=item Hybernate

When the system is hibernating, B<xde-sm> checkpoints the session state
to permanent storage.  This is so that the desktop may be restored if
the system fails to resume from hibernation.

=item Hybrid Suspend/Hybernate

When the system is performing a hybrid suspend/hibernate, B<xde-sm>
checkpoints the session state to permanent storage.  This is so that the
desktop may be restored if the system fails to resume from hibernation.

=item Shutdown

When the system is shutting down, B<xde-sm> checkpoints the session
state to permanent storage.  This is so that the desktop may be restored
when the system starts up again.

=item Restart

When the system is restarting, B<xde-sm> checkpoints the session state
to permanent storage.  This is so that the desktop may be restored when
the system restarts.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION

B<xde-sm> usually requires a change to your F<.xsession> or F<.xinitrc>
file.  The last program executed in your F<.xsession> or F<.xinitrc>
file should be B<xde-sm>.  With this configuration, when the user
chooses to shut down the session using B<xde-sm>, the session will be
truly over.

As the goal of the session manager is to restart clients when logging
into a session, your F<.xsession> file, in general, should not directly
start up applications.  Rather, the application should be started within
as session.  When B<xde-sm> shuts down the session, B<xde-sm> will know
to restart these applications.  Note, however, that there are some types
of applications that are not session-aware.  B<xde-sm> allows you to
explicitly add these applications to your session (see L</CLIENT LIST>).

The first time that B<xde-sm> is started, it will need to locate a list
of applications to start up.  For example, this list might include a
window manager (e.g. L<adwm(1)>), a session management proxy (e.g.
L<xde-smproxy(1)>, and an X terminal (e.g. L<xterm(1)>).  B<xde-sm> will
first look for the file F<.xsmstartup> in the user's home directory.  If
that file does not exist, it will look for the F<system.xsm> file that
was set up at installation time.  Note that B<xde-sm> provides a "fail
safe" option when the user chooses a session to start up.  The fail-safe
option simply loads the default applications described above.

Each line in the startup file should contain a command to start an
application.  A sample startup file might look like this:

 twm
 smproxy
 xterm

=head1 USAGE

A session is a group of applications, each of which has a particular
state.  B<xde-sm> allows you to create arbitrary sessions - for example,
you might have a "light" session, a "development" session, or an
"xterminal" session.  Each session can have its own set of applications.
Within a session, you can perform a "check-point" to save application
state, or a "shutdown" to save state and exit the session.  When you log
back into the system, you can load a specific session, and you can
delete sessions you no longer want to keep.

Some session managers simply allows you to manually specify a list of
applications to be started in a session.  B<xde-sm> is more powerful
because it lets you run applications and have them automatically become
part of the session.  On a simple level, B<xde-sm> is useful because it
gives you this ability to easily define which applications are in a
session.  The true power of B<xde-sm>, however, can be taken advantage
of when more and more applications learn to save and restore their
state.

=head1 BUGS

B<xde-sm> had no known bugs at the time of release.  Please report
bugs for current versions to the source code repository at
L<https://github.com/bbidulock/xde-session/issues>.

=head1 HISTORY

L<xsm(1)> has a number of deficiencies that I was trying to address by
writing the B<xde-sm> work-alike:

=over 4

=item 1.

L<xsm(1)> uses the old Athena widgets set.  B<xde-sm> uses the GTK+
toolkit.

=item 2.

L<xsm(1)> uses signals for remote control.  Signals can only be reliably
issued on the same machine as is running the session manager.  B<xde-sm>
also provides control of the session manager using X11 protocol client
messages.

=item 3.

L<xsm(1)> does not support L<ssh(1)> as a remote execution protocol,
only L<rstart(1)>, which is insecure.  B<xde-sm> uses L<ssh(1)> and
provides a proxy for session management by appropriately setting the
B<SESSION_MANAGER> environment variable to tunnel "session aware"
connections to the manager back to the session management host.

=item 4.

L<xsm(1)> and L<smproxy(1)> do not directly support XDG autostart.
B<xde-sm> supports XDG autostart by automatically adding autostart
clients to the session when they are not "session aware".  This is
partly addressed by B<xde-sm> and partly addressed by
L<xde-autostart(1)>.

=item 5.

L<xsm(1)> and L<smproxy(1)> do not support XDG startup notification.
XDG startup notification provides an additional mechanism for
determining the characteristics of clients that are not "session aware".

=back

I wrote B<xde-sm> to mitigate these issues as described, above.
