=head1 NAME

xde-xlogin - log into an X session

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B</usr/lib/X11/xdm/xde-xlogin> [I<OPTIONS>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<xde-xlogin> is an L<xdm(1)> xlogin and chooser replacement that
provides a much nicer appearing login screen for L<xdm(1)>.
It is designed to let L<xdm(1)> do the heavy lifting of coordinating the
majority of the XDMCP protocol while providing a more aesthetic
appearance.

=head1 OPTIONS

No options are necessary.  When launched by L<xdm(1)>, it will provide
the appropriate arguments.  B<xde-xlogin> can be launched directly on
the command line of an x-terminal to test its appearance and operation.
In this mode, arguments are still required but no options.  Absence of
the B<-xdmAddress>, B<-clientAddress> and B<-connectionType> options
indicates to B<xde-xlogin> that it was not launched by L<xdm(1)> or an
L<xdm(1)> work-alike as a chooser.  See L</USAGE> for more information.

=head2 COMMAND OPTIONS

Command options affect the major operating mode of the program.  Only
one command option may be specified (with the exception that B<--help>
can be specified in conjunction with any other command option).
When no command option is specified, B<xde-xlogin> executes the program.
The following command options, when specified, print information instead
of running the program.
The command options recognized by the program are as follows:

=over 4

=item B<-H>, B<-help>

Instead of operating normally, the program prints usage information to
standard output and exits.

=item B<-V>, B<--version>

Instead of operating normally, the program prints detailed version
information and exits.

=item B<-C>, B<--copying>

Instead of operating normally, the program prints detailed copying
permissions and exits.

=back

=head2 GENERAL OPTIONS

B<xde-xlogin> provides a set of general options that are not supported
by the L<xdm(1)> greeter or chooser.  To supply these options requires
an intermediate script that specifies them and echoes the L<xdm(1)>
chooser options.  So that an intermediate script is not necessary,
L<xdm(1)> provides an F<Xresources> files containing X resources that
are used instead of command line options to tailor the look and feel of
the greeter and chooser.  As a result, the use of the following command
line options are not necessary and are really only used for testing.

The following are the more general options:

=over 4

=item B<-p>, B<--prompt> I<MARKUP>

Specifies the F<pango> markup text that is to be displayed in the title
area of the panel.
When unspecified, the default welcome text is C<Welcome to %s!>, where C<%s>
is the fully qualified domain name of the local host.

As with the B<-banner> option, this option can easily be supplied by a
shell script between L<xdm(1)> and B<xde-xlogin> that adds the
options:

 #!/bin/sh
 XDM=/usr/lib/X11/xdm
 $XDM/xde-xlogin -prompt "Welcome to X!" \
	 -banner $XDM/banner.png $@

=item B<-b>, B<--banner> I<BANNER>

Specifies the banner graphic to display in the left pane of the panel.
L<xdm(1)> does not provide this option, but it can easily be
invoked by a shell script invoked by L<xdm(1)> that adds the options.
For example:

 #!/bin/sh
 XDM=/usr/lib/X11/xdm
 $XDM/xde-xlogin -banner $XDM/xde/banner.png $@

The default is obtained by looking for the file
F<${XDG_MENU_PREFIX}banner.{xpm,png,jpg,svg}> in the F<images>
sub-directory of standard XDG data directories, F<$XDG_DATA_DIRS>.  See
L</ENVIRONMENT>.

=item B<-S>, B<--splash> I<SPLASH>

Specifies the background image, I<SPLASH>, to display on the screen.
The default is to use the background image currently installed on the
screen, and if no background image is installed on the screen, to search
for the background image file in the file named
F<${XDG_MENU_PREFIX}splash.{xpm,png,jpg,svg}> in the F<images>
sub-directory of standard XDG data directories, F<$XDG_DATA_DIRS>.  See
L</ENVIRONMENT>.

L<xdm(1)> does not provide this option, but it can easily be
invoked by a shell script by L<xdm(1)> that adds the options.  For
example:

 #!/bin/sh
 XDM=/usr/lib/X11/xdm
 $XDM/xde-xlogin -splash $XDM/xde/splash.jpg $@

=item B<-s>, B<--side> {B<left>|B<top>|B<right>|B<bottom>}

Specifies the side on which to display branding (the banner graphic).
Can be one of I<top>, I<left>, I<bottom> or I<right>.  When unspecified,
the default is I<left>.

=item B<--charset> I<CHARSET>

Specifies the character set to use.  When unspecified, the character
set is determined using the current locale: see L<locale(7)>.

=item B<--language> I<LANGUAGE>

Specifies the language to use.  When unspecified, the language is
determined using the current locale: see L<locale(7)>.

=item B<-i>, B<--icons> I<ICON-THEME>

Specifies the GTK+ icon theme to use.  When unspecified, the icon theme
is automatically determined using desktop and toolkit files.

=item B<-T>, B<--theme> I<GTK2-THEME>

Specifies the GTK+ theme name to use.  When unspecified, the GTK2 theme
is automatically determined using desktop and toolkit files.

=item B<-u>, B<--xde-theme>

Specifies that the GTK+ icon theme and theme name to be used are those
of the X Desktop Environment (XDE) rather than the system default theme.
The default is to specify this flag.

=item B<--vendor> I<VENDOR>

Specifies the vendor identifier for branding.  The default, when
unspecified, is to used the value of environment variables
B<XDG_VENDOR_ID> and B<XDG_MENU_PREFIX> to determine the vendor name and
prefix.

=item B<-X>, B<--xsessions>

Specifies that available X sessions (window managers) should be provided
as a menu on the login window.  This allows a user to select an
available session before logging in.

=item B<--default> I<DEFAULT>

Specifies the default X session (window manager) name that should be
used when no X session is selected by the user.  This default is fed as
an argument to F<~/.xinitrc>.

=item B<--username> I<USERNAME>

Specifies the default user name for login.

=item B<--nosetbg>

Specifies that the background image should not be set by the program.
The default behaviour is to set the background in accordance with the
B<-banner> option.

=item B<-transparent>

Specifies that the login panel should be transparent and that the
widgets should be embedded in the background image.  The default is to
paint the login panel.

=item B<-n>, B<--dry-run>

Specifies that the program should not perform any actions but should
simply print intentions to standard output.  This option is for testing.

=item B<-D>, B<--debug> [I<LEVEL>]

Increase, or set to I<LEVEL>, the debugging verbosity.  The default
debugging verbosity level is zero (0), which means to output no
debugging information.  When non-zero, debugging information will be
printed to standard error.

=item B<-v>, B<--verbose> [I<LEVEL>]

Increase, or set to I<LEVEL>, the output verbosity.  The default output
verbosity level is one (1), which means to output normal information to
standard output.  When set to zero (0), no output will be printed to
standard output. 

=back

=head1 EXIT STATUS

When run as a I<greeter> program, instead of communicating using a
socket, the I<greeter> program can provide further instructions to
L<xdm(1)> based on the exit status of the I<greeter> program.
Therefore, the program provides the exit status values as follows:

=over 4

=item 0 - B<OBEYSESS_DISPLAY>

Obey the multiple sessions resource.

=item 1 - B<REMANAGE_DISPLAY>

Force re-management of the display.

=item 2 - B<UNMANAGE_DISPLAY>

=item 3 - B<RESERVER_DISPLAY>

Force server termination.

=item 4 - B<OPENFAILED_DISPLAY>

L<XOpenDisplay(1x)> failed, retry.

=back

=head1 USAGE

=head1 X RESOURCES

Most values that affect the look and feel of B<xde-xlogin> may also be
specified as X resources in the B<RESOURCE_MANAGER> database associated
with the X server.  All of these resources can have the specific
resource name and class (C<xde-xlogin>, C<XDE-XLogin>).  When no resource
is found with the specific name and class, L<xdm(1)> resources with name
and class (C<xlogin.Login>, C<Xlogin.Login>) will also be examined for
specified resources.

Note that L<xdm(1)> usually adds the resources contained in the
F</etc/X11/xdm/Xresources> file that is loaded by L<xdm(1)> on startup
to the resource database on the X server.  Chooser resource defaults
(see also L<xdm(1)> and L<xde-xchooser(1)>) are contained in the
F</usr/share/X11/app-defaults/Chooser> file.  Likewise, B<xde-xlogin>
specific resource defaults are contained in the
F</usr/share/X11/app-defaults/XDE-XLogin> file, in accordance with the
convention of naming applications default files after their resource
class. See also L</FILES>.

B<xde-xlogin> observes the following X11 Resource Manager resources when
loaded by L<xdm(1)> prior to execution:

=over 4

=item B<xde-xlogin>.B<x>: I<DOUBLE>

Specifies the X position on the monitor as a floating point number
between C<0.0> and C<1.0>, where C<0.0> represents the left edge of the

point depending on its gravity (currently static or centered).

=item B<xde-xlogin>.B<y>: I<DOUBLE>

Specifies the Y position on the monitor as a floating point number
between C<0.0> and C<1.0>, where C<0.0> represents the top edge of the
monitor and C<1.0>, the bottom edge.  The dialog will be positioned on
this point depending on its gravity (currently static or centered).

greeter or chooser programs.

=item F</etc/X11/xdm/xde/Xresources>

Because the greeter and chooser is associated with XDE, a complete set of
L<xdm(1)> configuration files, including the X resources file containing
B<XDE-XLogin> resources are contained in the F</etc/X11/xdm/xde>
sub-directory.  Application defaults are not loaded from anywhere else
for security.

=item F</usr/share/X11/app-defaults/XDE-XLogin>

X resource defaults for B<xde-xlogin>.
The program will load the default resources from this file and then
merge the resources specified in the B<RESOURCE_MANAGER> property on the
X display.  L<xdm(1)> will normally use L<xrdb(1)> to merge the
resources from the F</etc/X11/xdm/Xresources> into the
B<RESOURCE_MANAGER> property on the X display before launching the login
or greeter program.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

The following environment variables are considered by the program:

=over 4

=item B<XDG_VENDOR_ID>

When specified in the environment, the program will use the value of
this environment variable to form the default names of the B<--banner>
and B<--splash> files by prefixing it and a dash (C<->) to the default
banner or splash name.  This environment variable will be used in
preference to B<XDG_MENU_PREFIX> but can be overridden with the
B<--vendor> option.

=item B<XDG_MENU_PREFIX>

When specified in the environment, and neither the B<XDG_VENDOR_ID>
environment variable nor the B<--vendor> option are specified, the
program will use the value of this environment variable to form the
default names of the B<--banner> and B<--splash> files by prefixing it
to the default banner or splash name.  This environment variable will be
overridden by either of the B<XDG_VENDOR_ID> environment variable or
B<--vendor> option.

=item B<XDG_DATA_DIRS>

When specified, specifies the path of XDG data directories that will be
searched for banner or splash files.  When unspecified, defaults to
F</usr/local/share:/usr/share> in accordance with XDG specifications.

=head1 BUGS

B<xde-xlogin> had no known bugs at the time of release.  Please report
bugs for current versions to the source code repository at
L<https://github.com/bbidulock/xde-session/issues>.

=head1 HISTORY

I used to use a patched version of L<slim(1)> for this purpose; however,
L<slim(1)> has deficiencies with regard to establishing XDE sessions and
has no provision for being used as a B<chooser>.

Historically, L<xdm(1)> has provided a I<greeter> and a I<chooser>.  The
I<greeter> was a graphical login program that was integrated with
L<xdm(1)>.  The I<chooser> was a graphical XDCMP chooser program that,
while part of the XDM distribution, was a separate program launched by
L<xdm(1)>.  Both of these programs used the archaic Athena widget set.

The XDE fork of L<xdm(1)> provides for a separate I<greeter> program to
be used for graphical login.  Originally, XDE used a modified version of
the L<slim(1)> login manager to act also as a I<greeter> for L<xdm(1)>.
A I<chooser> program was written using perl-gtk2 to act as a much nicer
looking and more fully IPv6 functional I<chooser> program.

This then begged the question as to why there needed to be a separate
I<greeter> and I<chooser>.  Why should not the user be able to login to
the local machine, or choose to login to a remote machine instead.
After all, choosing the local machine from the I<greeter> functions
similar to a I<greeter>.

L<slim(1)> took the approach that logging into an X server is not that
terribly different to unlocking a screen saver.  Why should not the same
appearance code be used for both.  This led XDE to use a related
program, L<xde-xlock(1)> to provide the screen locking mechanism for XDE
in the same fashion as the display manager programs.

Traditional display managers for Linux, such as L<gdm(1)>, have also
taken the approach that choosing an X session (well, at least an
C<XSession> F<.desktop> file to run) could also be performed during
login, instead of selecting one after the login process.
