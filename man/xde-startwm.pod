=head1 NAME

 xde-startwm - start a window-manager session

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 xde-startwm [ COMMAND ] [ OPTIONS ] [ SESSION ]
 xde-startwm --help

 xde-startwm help
 xde-startwm edit    [ OPTIONS ]
 xde-startwm run     [ OPTIONS ] COMMAND ARG ...
 xde-startwm start   [ OPTIONS ] [ SESSION ]
 xde-startwm restart [ OPTIONS ] [ SESSION ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<xde-startwm> starts a new X session, optionally launches a window
manager, and optionally starts any additional applications or XDG
auto-start applications as specified by the I<XDG Desktop Specification>. 

See the L</USAGE> section for usage examples.

=head1 COMMANDS

Command options that control the major behaviour of B<xde-startwm> are as
follows:

=over 4

=item B<--help>, B<help>

Print a brief usage message to stdout and then exit.

=item B<--test>, B<test>

Regardless of the other options, do not launch any tasks or perform any
other actions that would conflict with another running B<xde-startwm>.
Also, do not guarantee that the running B<xde-startwm> is unique for the
display.  This is for testing, to see visually what B<xde-startwm> would
do and to allow for the testing and development of the task monitor and
session editor.

=item B<--edit>, B<-m>, B<edit>

Invoke the session editor dialog on the running lxsession (or a new
editor when B<--test> is specified or no xde-startwm is running).

Most of the command line options are intended for use by X
initialization scripts (such as those in L<xmd(1)>) that invoke the X
session.  Many additional options are available only through the
configuration file or the editor.

=item B<--run>, B<-u>, B<exec>

Ask a running B<xde-startwm> instance to launch and manage a program

=item B<--restart>, B<-r>

=back

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over

=item I<SESSION>

B<xde-startwm> only recognizes a single optional non-option argument,
I<SESSION>.  When specified this argument has the same effect as the
B<--session> argument and overrides the setting of both the B<--session>
argument, the B<XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP> and the B<DESKTOP_SESSION>
environment variables.

=back

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<--display>, B<-d> I<DISPLAY>

Specifies the display to use.  This is not normally necessary as the
display is obtained from the B<DISPLAY> environment variable when this
option is not specified.

=item B<--desktop>, B<-e> I<DESKTOP>

Specify the desktop environment (DE) to use, I<DESKTOP>, e.g.
C<FLUXBOX>, C<BLACKBOX>, C<ICEWM>, C<LXDE>.  The default value when not
specified is C<FLUXBOX>.  The desktop environment must be specified when
B<--autostart> is specified.

In L<lxsession(1)> compatibility mode, this is equivalent to the B<-e>
option to L<lxsession(1)>.  This option may also be specified using the
B<XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP> or B<FBXDG_DE> environment variables described
below.

=item B<--session>, B<-s> I<SESSION>

Invokes L<lxsession(1)> compatibility mode, and specifies the session
profile to use for emulating L<lxsession(1)>.  This is equivalent to the
B<-s> option to L<lxsession(1)>.  This option may also be specified
using the B<DESKTOP_SESSION> environment variable as described below.

=item B<--startwm>, B<-m> I<EXECUTE>

Execute the command string, I<EXECUTE>, to start a window manager.
Shell characters will be interpreted.  When specified, the window
manager will be started before all other tasks.

When not specified, this option will be determined from the
L<session.conf> file in the F<SESSION> subdirectory under
F<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xde-startwm>, where F<SESSION> is specified by the
B<-s> option, or by the first non-option argument.

In L<lxsession(1)> compatibility mode, this option will be determined
from the L<lxsession(1)> F<desktop.conf> file in the F<SESSION>
subdirectory under F<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lxsession>, where F<SESSION> is
specified with the B<-s> option.

=item B<--file>, B<-f> I<FILE>

Execute the commands contained in the file, I<FILE>, after executing the
window manager, but before executing any other commands or auto-starting
tasks.  File is compatible with the L<lxsession(1)> F<autostart> file.
Each line of the file contains a shell command to execute, optionally
prefixed with a C<@> to indicate that the process should be restarted
when it exits abnormally.  Tasks executed from this file will be started
before any specified by the B<-x> option, or auto-started from XDG
autostart desktop files.

In L<lxsession(1)> compatibility mode, this option will default to the
F<autostart> file in the F<SESSION> subdirectory under
F<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lxsession>, where F<SESSION> is specified with the
B<-s> option.

=item B<--setup>, I<COMMAND>

Execute the command string, I<COMMAND>, to setup the window manager
before it is invoked.  This option defaults to executing the shell setup
program in F<$XDG_CONFIG_{HOME,DIRS}/\LDESKTOP\E/setup.sh> if such a shell
exists.  The option may be repeated to execute a number of commands in the
order specified.  These commands are executed in the foreground, one after
the other, before the window manager or any other task is started.  The
session will die if any of these commands exit with a non-zero exit status
or terminate on a signal.

=item B<--exec>, B<-x> I<COMMAND>

Execute the command string, I<COMMAND>, to start applications after the
window manager, and before autostart tasks are executed.  This option
defaults to none.  The option may be repeated to execute a number of
commands the order specified.  It is possible to prefix the I<COMMAND>
string with a single C<@> that will indicate that the task should be
restarted when it exits abnormally.

=item B<--autostart>, B<--noautostart>, B<-a>

Specifies whether (or not) to autostart XDG applications in accordance
with the I<Desktop Application Autostart Specification>.  The inverted
sense of the B<-a> flag is for compatibility with L<lxsession(1)>.

=item B<--wait>, B<-w>, B<--nowait>

Specifies whether (or not) to wait for a EWMH/NetWM compatible window
manager to take control of the root window of the default screen of the
display before starting further applications.  This option takes effect
regardless of whether the B<--startwm> option has been specified.

=item B<--pause>, B<-p> [I<PAUSE>]

Specifies the interval of time, I<PAUSE>, in seconds to wait after the
window manager initialization phase before starting the first
applications.  If I<PAUSE> is not specified, it defaults to 2 seconds.
The default when the option is not specified is not to pause at all.
The pause can be explicitly disable by using a I<PAUSE> value of zero
(0).

=item B<--splash>, B<-l> [I<IMAGE>]

Specifies that a splash window is to be generated and optionally
populated with an image from the file, I<IMAGE>, (that can be in XPM or
PNG format).  The splash window will display the icons of the XDG
compliant F<*.desktop> files as they are started.  The I<IMAGE> is for
optional branding.

=back

=head1 USAGE

B<xde-startwm> is intended on being launched by the L<xdg_session(8)>
shell script.  See the L<xdg_session(8)> manual page for details on its
operation.

When used directly, B<xde-startwm> will launch the following window
managers (and likely others as a variation on a theme) successfully:

=over 4

=item B<FLUXBOX>

Simply execute B<xde-startwm> as the only command in your
F<~/.fluxbox/startup> file.  The execution line should look like:

 xde-startwm --desktop FLUXBOX --startwm "fluxbox -rc ~/.fluxbox/init"

where F<~/.fluxbox/init> is just the default.  Use B<xde-startwm-edit(1)>
to auto-start the programs that you would otherwise start from your
F<startup> script.  Therefore the above command bypasses the normal
F<startup> script, which is likely unaware of B<xde-startwm>.

=item B<BLACKBOX>

Where you would invoke L<blackbox(1)>, invoke the following:

 xde-startwm --desktop BLACKBOX --startwm "blackbox -rc ~/.blackboxrc"

where F<~/.blackboxrc> is just the default.

=item B<ICEWM>

L<icewm(1)> user normally either launch L<icewm(1)> alone or
L<icewm-session(1)>.  L<icewm-session(1)> provides some limited
auto-starting of applications (it forks L<icewwmtray(1)> and
L<icewmbg(1)> as well as L<icewm(1)> itself), but does not support XDG
Autostart, XSETTINGS and Startup Notification.

=item B<OPENBOX>

L<openbox(1)> is typically started either using L<openbox-session(1)>
directly, or under LXDE using L<lxdestart(1)>.

=item B<WMAKER>

L<wmaker(1)> has its own non-XDG compliant session management.  This
means that if B<xde-startwm> is used to launch WindowMaker, it should be
made to suppress XDG auto-start tasks using the B<--noautostart> or B<-a>
option, such as:

 xde-startwm --noautostart --desktop WMAKER --startwm wmaker

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

=head1 FILES

=over

=item F<$XDG_CONFIG_{HOME,DIRS}/lxsession/SESSION/autostart>

The default F<autostart> files in L<lxsession(1)> compatibility mode.
Note that the values from B<all> auto-start files will be used.

=item F<$XDG_CONFIG_{HOME,DIRS}/lxsession/SESSION/desktop.conf>

The default F<desktop.conf> file in L<lxsession(1)> compatibility mode.
Note that the values from only the file in the "most important"
directory will be used.

=back

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

The following environment variables are examined or set by B<xde-startwm>:

=over 4

=item B<HOME>

Will be used to determine the user's home directory for the purpose of
calculating the default value for C<XDG_CONFIG_HOME> when required.

=item B<XDG_CONFIG_HOME>

When set, C<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/autostart> will be examined for
C<*.desktop> files.  The variable defaults to C<$HOME/.config>.

=item B<XDG_CONFIG_DIRS>

When set, C<DIRECTORY/autostart> will be examined for each C<DIRECTORY>
in the colon separated list of directories contained in
C<XDG_CONFIG_DIRS>.  The variable defaults to C</etc/xdg>.

=item B<XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP>

When the C<--desktop> option is not specified, C<XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP> is
examined to determine the current desktop.  C<XDG_CURRENT DESKTOP> is
set to the value that resulted from option and environment variable
processing for children of the session.

=item B<FBXDG_DE>

To emulate L<fbautostart>, the C<FBXDG_DE> environment variable is
examined when the C<--desktop> option is not specified and the
C<XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP> environment variable is not set.  C<FBXDG_DE> is
set to the value that resulted from option and environment variable
processing for children of the session.

=item B<DESKTOP_SESSION>

To emulate L<lxsession(1)>, the C<DESKTOP_SESSION> environment variable
is set to the value that resulted from potion and enviroment variable
processing for children of the session.

=item B<XDG_SESSION_PID>

C<XDG_SESSION_PID> is set to the PID of B<xde-startwm>, the process group
leader responsible for launching all tasks under the X session manager.
The X session can be terminated by killing this process.

=item B<_LXSESSION_PID>

To emulate L<lxsession(1)>, the C<_LXSESSION_PID> environment variable
is set to the PID of B<xde-startwm>, the process group leader responsible
for launching all tasks under the X session manager.  The X session can
be terminated by killing this process.

=back

=head1 SIGNALS

=over

=item I<SIGTERM>

A I<SIGTERM> signal sent to the C<$XDG_SESSION_PID> or
C<$_LXSESSION_PID> will terminate the entire session.  This should be
avoided when the window manager does not properly catch termination
signals and save its configuration before terminating.

When the B<--startwm> option is specified or implied, B<xde-startwm> will
also terminate when the window manager exits normally.

=back

=head1 CAVEATS

When in L<lxsession(1)> compatibility mode, B<xde-startwm> cannot act as
an Xsettings daemon in accordance with the Xsettings specification.
L<lxsession(1)> can.

=head1 BUGS

B<xde-startwms> had no known bugs at the time of release.  Please report
bugs for current versions to the source code repository at
L<https://github.com/bbidulock/xde-session/issues>.

=head1 HISTORY

I wrote B<xde-startwm> due to the deficiencies of B<fbautostart(1)> and
L<lxsession(1)> when launching XDG-compliant applications and desktop
environments over NWM/ENWM compliant light-weight window managers.  The
program was originally written in C<perl>, but later ported to C<C>.
