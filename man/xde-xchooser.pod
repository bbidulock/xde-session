=head1 NAME

xde-xchooser - A GTK2 XDMCP Host chooser replacement.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B</usr/lib/X11/xdm/xde-xchooser> [I<OPTIONS>] ADDRESSES ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<xde-xchooser> is a GTK2 replacement for the horribly ugly Athena
Widget Set chooser that comes with Xorg X Display Manager.
It is designed to let L<xdm(1)> do the heavy lifting of coordinating the
majority of the XDMCP protocol while providing a more aesthetic
appearance.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item I<ADDRESSES ...>

Provides the human-readable (decimal and dot notation, host names)
specification of the display managers to query to determine whether they
are willing to manage a display.  In addition to all manner of textual
IP addresses, the special value C<BROADCAST> can be specified to indicate
to the chooser that it should (also) broadcast queries to discover
display managers.  The special value C<DNS-SD> can be specified to
indicate to the chooser that it should (also) use C<DNS-SD> to discover
display managers that offer the C<tcp.xdmcp> service.  The special
value C<MULTICAST> can be specified to indicate to the chooser that it
should (also) use multicast to discover display managers.

=back

=head1 OPTIONS

No options are necessary.  When launched by L<xdm(1)>, it will provide
the appropriate arguments.  B<xde-xchooser> can be launched directly on
the command line of an x-terminal to test its appearance and operation.
In this mode, arguments are still required but no options.  Absence of
the B<-xdmAddress>, B<-clientAddress> and B<-connectionType> options
indicates to B<xde-xchooser> that it was not launched by L<xdm(1)> or an
L<xdm(1)> work-alike as a chooser.  See L</USAGE> for more information.

=head2 COMMAND OPTIONS

When no command option is specified, B<xde-xchooser> executes the program.
The following command options, when specified, print information instead
of running the program.

=over 4

=item B<-H>, B<-help>

Instead of operating normally, the program prints usage information to
standard output and exits.

=item B<-V>, B<--version>

Instead of operating normally, the program prints detailed version
information and exits.

=item B<-C>, B<--copying>

Instead of operating normally, the program prints detailed copying
permissions and exits.

=back

=head2 XDM OPTIONS

XDM options are not normally specified by the user of the program on the
command line: they are, instead, provided by L<xdm(1)> when
B<xde-xchooser> is being used as a I<chooser> program.  Note that none
of these options are provided when L<xdm(1)> runs the program as a
I<greeter>.  See L</HISTORY>.

=over 4

=item B<-xdmAddress> I<ADDRESS>

Specifies the address of a TCP socket upon which L<xdm(1)> is awaiting
instructions for the server.  L<xdm(1)> encodes this I<ADDRESS> as a
string of hexadecimal characters (with no 0x prefix) representing the
binary socket address.  The first two bytes are a host-byte-order 16-bit
address family (e.g. AF_INET); the second and third bytes are the
host-byte-order 16-bit port number; and the remaining 4 or 16 bytes are
the IPv4 or IPv6 network-byte-order IP address.

B<xde-xchooser> uses the socket address communicated in this option to
communicate the selection back to L<xdm(1)>.

=item B<-clientAddress> I<IPADDR>

Specifies the client IP address I<IPADDR> that initiated the request.
L<xdm(1)> encodes this as a string of hexadecimal characters (with no 0x
prefix) representing the 4- or 16-byte IPv4 or IPv6 network-byte-order
IP address.

B<xde-xchooser> uses this option to identify the originating client back
to L<xdm(1)> when a selection is made.

=item B<-connectionType> I<TYPE>

Specifies the connection type supported by the client as a decimal
number, I<TYPE>.

B<xde-xchooser> uses this option to filter the list of willing display
managers to those that support this connection type.  The three types of
interest to L<xdm(1)> (see F</usr/include/X11/Xdmcp.h>) are:

=over 4

=item 0 - B<FamilyInternet> (AF_INET addresses only)

=item 6 - B<FamilyInternet6> (AF_INET6 addresses only)

=item 256 - B<FamilyLocal> (AF_UNIX addresses only)

=back

L<xdm(1)> will only supply B<FamilyInternet>(0) or B<FamilyInternet6>(6).

=back

=head2 GENERAL OPTIONS

B<xde-xchooser> provides a set of general options that are not supported
by the L<xdm(1)> greeter or chooser.  To supply these options requires
an intermediate script that specifies them and echoes the L<xdm(1)>
chooser options.  So that an intermediate script is not necessary,
L<xdm(1)> provides an F<Xresources> files containing X resources that
are used instead of command line options to tailor the look and feel of
the greeter and chooser.  As a result, the use of the following command
line options are not necessary and are really only used for testing.

The following are the more general options:

=over 4

=item B<-welcome> I<MARKUP>

Specifies the pango markup text that is to be displayed in the title
area of the host menu.  As with the B<-banner> option, this option can
easily be supplied by a shell script between L<xdm(1)> and
B<xde-xchooser> that adds the options:

 #!/bin/sh
 /usr/bin/xde-xchooser -welcome "Welcome to X!" \
         -banner /usr/lib/X11/xdm/banner.png $@

When unspecified, the default welcome text is C<Welcome to %s!>, where C<%s>
is the fully qualified domain name of the local host.

=item B<-banner> I<PNGFILE>

Specifies the banner graphic to display in the left pane of the host
menu.  L<xdm(1)> does not provide this option, but it can easily be
invoked by a shell script invoked by L<xdm(1)> that adds the options.
For example:

 #!/bin/sh
 /usr/bin/xde-xchooser -banner /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xde/banner.png $@

When unspecified, the program searches for an image file named
F<${XDG_VENDOR_ID--}banner.{xpm,png,jpg,svg}> in the subdirectory
F<images> in XDG data directories.

=item B<-splash> I<JPGFILE>

Specifies the graphic to use as the root window background for the
greeter and chooser.  L<xdm(1)> does not provide this option, but it can easily be
invoked by a shell script by L<xdm(1)> that adds the options.  For
example:

 #!/bin/sh
 /usr/bin/xde-xchooser -splash /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xde/splash.jpg $@

When unspecified, the program searches for an image file named
F<${XDG_VENDOR_ID:--}splash.{xpm,png,jpg,svg}> in the subdirectory
F<images> in XDG data directories.

=item B<-side> {B<top>|B<left>|B<bottom>|B<right>}

Specifies the side on which to display branding (the banner graphic).
Can be one of I<top>, I<left>, I<bottom> or I<right>.  When unspecified,
the default is I<left>.

=item B<-charset> I<CHARSET>

Specifies the character set to use.  When unspecified, the character
set is determined using the current locale: see L<locale(7)>.

=item B<-language> I<LANGUAGE>

Specifies the language to use.  When unspecified, the language is
determined using the current locale: see L<locale(7)>.

=item B<-icons> I<ICON-THEME>

Specifies the GTK+ icon theme to use.  When unspecified, the icon theme
is automatically determined using desktop and toolkit files.

=item B<-theme> I<GTK2-THEME>

Specifies the GTK+ theme name to use.  When unspecified, the GTK2 theme
is automatically determined using desktop and toolkit files.

=item B<-xde-theme>

Specifies that the GTK+ icon theme and theme name to be used are those
of the X Desktop Environment (XDE) rather than the system default theme.
The default is to specify this flag.

=item B<-vendor> I<VENDOR>

Specifies the vendor identifier for branding.  The default, when
unspecified, is to used the value of environment variables
B<XDG_VENDOR_ID> and B<XDG_MENU_PREFIX> to determine the vendor name and
prefix.

=item B<-xsessions>

Specifies that available X sessions (window managers) should be provided
as a menu on the login window.  This allows a user to select an
available session before logging in.

=item B<-default> I<DEFAULT>

Specifies the default X session (window manager) name that should be
used when no X session is selected by the user.  This default is fed as
an argument to F<~/.xinitrc>.

=item B<-username> I<USERNAME>

Specifies the default user name for login.

=item B<-nosetbg>

Specifies that the background image should not be set by the program.
The default behaviour is to set the background in accordance with the
B<-banner> option.

=item B<-transparent>

Specifies that the login panel should be transparent and that the
widgets should be embedded in the background image.  The default is to
paint the login panel.

=item B<-n>, B<--dry-run>

Specifies that the program should not perform any actions but should
simply print intentions to standard output.  This option is for testing.

=item B<-D>, B<--debug> [I<LEVEL>]

Increase, or set to I<LEVEL>, the debugging verbosity.  The default
debugging verbosity level is zero (0), which means to output no
debugging information.  When non-zero, debugging information will be
printed to standard error.

=item B<-v>, B<--verbose> [I<LEVEL>]

Increase, or set to I<LEVEL>, the output verbosity.  The default output
verbosity level is one (1), which means to output normal information to
standard output.  When set to zero (0), no output will be printed to
standard output. 

=back

=head1 EXIT STATUS

When run as a I<greeter> program, instead of communicating using a
socket, the I<greeter> program can provide further instructions to
L<xdm(1)> based on the exit status of the I<greeter> program.
Therefore, the program provides the exit status values as follows:

=over 4

=item 0 - B<OBEYSESS_DISPLAY>

Obey the multiple sessions resource.

=item 1 - B<REMANAGE_DISPLAY>

Force re-management of the display.

=item 2 - B<UNMANAGE_DISPLAY>

Force deletion of the display.

=item 3 - B<RESERVER_DISPLAY>

Force server termination.

=item 4 - B<OPENFAILED_DISPLAY>

L<XOpenDisplay(1x)> failed, retry.

=back

=head1 X RESOURCES

Most values that affect the look and feel of B<xde-xchooser> may also be
specified as X resources in the B<RESOURCE_MANAGER> database associated
with the X server.  All of these resources can have the specific
resource name and class (C<xde-xchooser>, C<XDE-XChooser>).  When no resource
is found with the specific name and class, L<xdm(1)> resources with name
and class (C<chooser>, C<Chooser>) will also be examined for
specified resources.

Note that L<xdm(1)> usually adds the resources contained in the
F</etc/X11/xdm/Xresources> file that is loaded by L<xdm(1)> on startup
to the resource database on the X server.  Chooser resource defaults
(see also L<xdm(1)> and L<xde-xlogin(1)>) are contained in the
F</usr/share/X11/app-defaults/Chooser> file.  Likewise, B<xde-xchooser>
specific resource defaults are contained in the
F</usr/share/X11/app-defaults/XDE-XChooser> file, in accordance with the
convention of naming applications default files after their resource
class.  See also L</FILES>.

B<xde-xchooser> observes the following X11 Resource Manager resources when
loaded by L<xdm(1)> prior to execution:

=over 4

=item B<xde-xchooser>.B<x>: I<DOUBLE>

Specifies the X position on the monitor as a floating point number
between C<0.0> and C<1.0>, where C<0.0> represents the left edge of the
monitor and C<1.0>, the right edge.  The dialog will be positioned on this
point depending on its gravity (currently static or centered).

=item B<xde-xchooser>.B<y>: I<DOUBLE>

Specifies the Y position on the monitor as a floating point number
between C<0.0> and C<1.0>, where C<0.0> represents the top edge of the

This option, described in L<xdm(1)>, is used to tell L<xdm(1)> which
program to run as a greeter.  This should be set to
F</usr/bin/xde-xchooser>.  See L<xdm(1)/AUTHENTICATION WIDGET>.

=head1 FILES

=over 4

=item F</usr/lib/X11/xdm/xde-xchooser>

The default location of the B<xde-xchooser> executable.
As this is not useful for normal users, it does not reside in the
F</usr/bin> directory.

=item F</usr/lib/X11/xdm/banner.png>

The default location of the banner graphic.

=item F</etc/X11/xdm/Xresources>

The normal location of the X resources file for L<xdm(1)>.  Normally,
L<xdm(1)> will merge the resources found in this file into the X display
B<RESOURCE_MANAGER> property on the root window before launching the
greeter or chooser programs.

=item F</etc/X11/xdm/xde/Xresources>

Because the greeter and chooser is associated with XDE, a complete set of
L<xdm(1)> configuration files, including the X resources file containing
B<XDE-XChooser> resources are contained in the F</etc/X11/xdm/xde>
subdirectory.  Application defaults are not loaded from anywhere else
for security.

=item F</usr/share/X11/app-defaults/XDE-XChooser>

X resource defaults for B<xde-xchooser>.
The program will load the default resources from this file and then
merge the resources specified in the B<RESOURCE_MANAGER> property on the
X display.  L<xdm(1)> will normally use L<xrdb(1)> to merge the
resources from the F</etc/X11/xdm/Xresources> into the
B<RESOURCE_MANAGER> property on the X display before launching the login
or greeter program.

=head1 USAGE

=head1 BUGS

B<xde-xchooser> had no known bugs at the time of release.  Please report
bugs for current versions to the source code repository at
L<https://github.com/bbidulock/xde-session/issues>.

=head1 HISTORY

This program was originally written as a GTK2-perl script, but I don't
like running GTK2-perl scripts as root, do you?  Also, I wanted to
permit the program to redirect a user X session, or to redirect a Xephyr
session, and this close interaction with the X server was not available
in perl.  You can check out the original perl version at
L<http://github.com/bbidulock/gchooser>.

Historically, L<xdm(1)> has provided a I<greeter> and a I<chooser>.  The
I<greeter> was a graphical login program that was integrated with
L<xdm(1)>.  The I<chooser> was a graphical XDCMP chooser program that,
while part of the XDM distribution, was a separate program launched by
L<xdm(1)>.  Both of these programs used the archaic Athena widget set.

The XDE fork of L<xdm(1)> provides for a separate I<greeter> program to
be used for graphical login.  Originally, XDE used a modified version of
the L<slim(1)> login manager to act also as a I<greeter> for L<xdm(1)>.
A I<chooser> program was written using perl-gtk2 to act as a much nicer
looking and more fully IPv6 functional I<chooser> program.

This then begged the question as to why there needed to be a separate
I<greeter> and I<chooser>.  Why should not the user be able to login to
the local machine, or choose to login to a remote machine instead.
After all, choosing the local machine from the I<greeter> functions
similar to a I<greeter>.

L<slim(1)> took the approach that logging into an X server is not that
terribly different to unlocking a screen saver.  Why should not the same
appearance code be used for both.  This led XDE to use a related
program, L<xde-xlock(1)> to provide the screen locking mechanism for XDE
in the same fashion as the display manager programs.

Traditional display managers for Linux, such as L<gdm(1)>, have also
taken the approach that choosing an X session (well, at least an
C<XSession> F<.desktop> file to run) could also be performed during
login, instead of selecting one after the login process.
