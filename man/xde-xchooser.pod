=head1 NAME

xde-xchooser - A GTK2 XDMCP Host chooser replacement.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B</usr/lib/X11/xdm/xde-xchooser> [I<OPTIONS>] ADDRESSES ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<xde-xchooser> is a GTK2 replacement for the horribly ugly Athena
Widget Set chooser that comes with Xorg X Display Manager.
It is designed to let L<xdm(8)> do the heavy lifting of coordinating the
majority of the XDMCP protocol while providing a more aesthetic
appearance.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item I<ADDRESSES ...>

Provides the human-readable (decimal and dot notation, host names)
specification of the display managers to query to determine whether they
are willing to manage a display.  In addition to all manner of textual
IP addresses, the special value C<BROADCAST> can be specified to indicate
to the chooser that it should (also) broadcast queries to discover
display managers.  The special value C<DNS-SD> can be specified to
indicate to the chooser that it should (also) use C<DNS-SD> to discover
display managers that offer the C<tcp.xdmcp> service.  The special
value C<MULTICAST> can be specified to indicate to the chooser that it
should (also) use multicast to discover display managers.

=back

=head1 OPTIONS

No options are necessary.  When launched by L<xdm(8)>, it will provide
the appropriate arguments.  B<xde-xchooser> can be launched directly on
the command line of an x-terminal to test its appearance and operation.
In this mode, arguments are still required but no options.  Absence of
the B<-xdmAddress>, B<-clientAddress> and B<-connectionType> options
indicates to B<xde-xchooser> that it was not launched by L<xdm(8)> or an
L<xdm(8)> work-alike as a chooser.  See L</USAGE> for more information.

=head2 COMMAND OPTIONS

Command options affect the major operating mode of the program.  Only
one command option may be specified (with the exception that B<--help>
can be specified in conjunction with any other command option).
When no command option is specified, B<xde-xchooser> executes the program.
The following command options, when specified, print information instead
of running the program.
The command options recognized by the program are as follows:

=over 4

=item B<-H>, B<-help>

Instead of operating normally, the program prints usage information to
standard output and exits.

=item B<-V>, B<--version>

Instead of operating normally, the program prints detailed version
information and exits.

=item B<-C>, B<--copying>

Instead of operating normally, the program prints detailed copying
permissions and exits.

=back

=head2 XDM OPTIONS

XDM options are not normally specified by the user of the program on the
command line: they are, instead, provided by L<xdm(8)> when
B<xde-xchooser> is being used as a I<chooser> program.  Note that none
of these options are provided when L<xdm(8)> runs the program as a
I<greeter>.  See L</HISTORY>.

=over 4

=item B<-xdmAddress> I<ADDRESS>

Specifies the address of a TCP socket upon which L<xdm(8)> is awaiting
instructions for the server.  L<xdm(8)> encodes this I<ADDRESS> as a
string of hexadecimal characters (with no 0x prefix) representing the
binary socket address.  The first two bytes are a host-byte-order 16-bit
address family (e.g. AF_INET); the second and third bytes are the
host-byte-order 16-bit port number; and the remaining 4 or 16 bytes are
the IPv4 or IPv6 network-byte-order IP address.

B<xde-xchooser> uses the socket address communicated in this option to
communicate the selection back to L<xdm(8)>.

=item B<-clientAddress> I<IPADDR>

Specifies the client IP address I<IPADDR> that initiated the request.
L<xdm(8)> encodes this as a string of hexadecimal characters (with no 0x
prefix) representing the 4- or 16-byte IPv4 or IPv6 network-byte-order
IP address.

B<xde-xchooser> uses this option to identify the originating client back
to L<xdm(8)> when a selection is made.

=item B<-connectionType> I<TYPE>

Specifies the connection type supported by the client as a decimal
number, I<TYPE>.

B<xde-xchooser> uses this option to filter the list of willing display
managers to those that support this connection type.  The three types of
interest to L<xdm(8)> (see F</usr/include/X11/Xdmcp.h>) are:

=over 4

=item 0 - B<FamilyInternet> (AF_INET addresses only)

=item 6 - B<FamilyInternet6> (AF_INET6 addresses only)

=item 256 - B<FamilyLocal> (AF_UNIX addresses only)

=back

L<xdm(8)> will only supply B<FamilyInternet>(0) or B<FamilyInternet6>(6).

=back

=head2 GENERAL OPTIONS

B<xde-xchooser> provides a set of general options that are not supported
by the L<xdm(8)> greeter or chooser.  To supply these options requires
an intermediate script that specifies them and echoes the L<xdm(8)>
chooser options.  So that an intermediate script is not necessary,
L<xdm(8)> provides an F<Xresources> file containing X resources that are
used instead of command line options to tailor the look and feel of the
chooser.  As a result, the use of the following command line options are
not necessary and are really only used for testing.

The following are the more general options:

=over 4

=item B<-w>, B<--welcome> I<MARKUP>

Specifies the F<pango> markup text that is to be displayed in the title
area of the panel.
When unspecified, the default welcome text is C<Welcome to %s!>, where C<%s>
is the fully qualified domain name of the local host.

As with the B<-banner> option, this option can easily be supplied by a
shell script between L<xdm(8)> and B<xde-xchooser> that adds the
options:

 #!/bin/sh
 /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xde-xchooser -welcome "Welcome to X!" \
         -banner /usr/lib/X11/xdm/banner.png $@

=item B<-b>, B<--banner> I<BANNER>

Specifies the banner graphic to display in the left pane of the panel.
L<xdm(8)> does not provide this option, but it can easily be
invoked by a shell script invoked by L<xdm(8)> that adds the options.
For example:

 #!/bin/sh
 /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xde-xchooser -banner /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xde/banner.png $@

The default is obtained by looking for the file
F<${XDG_MENU_PREFIX}banner.{xpm,png,jpg,svg}> in the F<images>
subdirectory of standard XDG data directories, F<$XDG_DATA_DIRS>.  See
L</ENVIRONMENT>.

=item B<-S>, B<--splash> I<SPLASH>

Specifies the background image, I<SPLASH>, to display on the screen.
The default is to use the background image currently installed on the
screen, and if no background image is installed on the screen, to search
for the background image file in the file named
F<${XDG_MENU_PREFIX}splash.{xpm,png,jpg,svg}> in the F<images>
subdirectory of standard XDG data directories, F<$XDG_DATA_DIRS>.  See
L</ENVIRONMENT>.

L<xdm(8)> does not provide this option, but it can easily be
invoked by a shell script by L<xdm(8)> that adds the options.  For
example:

 #!/bin/sh
 /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xde-xchooser -splash /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xde/splash.jpg $@

=item B<-s>, B<--side> {B<left>|B<top>|B<right>|B<bottom>}

Specifies the side on which to display branding (the banner graphic).
Can be one of I<top>, I<left>, I<bottom> or I<right>.  When unspecified,
the default is I<left>.

=item B<--charset> I<CHARSET>

Specifies the character set to use.  When unspecified, the character
set is determined using the current locale: see L<locale(7)>.

=item B<--language> I<LANGUAGE>

Specifies the language to use.  When unspecified, the language is
determined using the current locale: see L<locale(7)>.

=item B<-i>, B<--icons> I<ICON-THEME>

Specifies the GTK+ icon theme to use.  When unspecified, the icon theme
is automatically determined using desktop and toolkit files.

=item B<-e>, B<--theme> I<GTK2-THEME>

Specifies the GTK+ theme name to use.  When unspecified, the GTK2 theme
is automatically determined using desktop and toolkit files.

=item B<-u>, B<--xde-theme>

Specifies that the GTK+ icon theme and theme name to be used are those
of the X Desktop Environment (XDE) rather than the system default theme.
The default is to specify this flag.

=item B<--vendor> I<VENDOR>

Specifies the vendor identifier for branding.  The default, when
unspecified, is to used the value of environment variables
B<XDG_VENDOR_ID> and B<XDG_MENU_PREFIX> to determine the vendor name and
prefix.

=item B<-X>, B<--xsessions>

Specifies that available X sessions (window managers) should be provided
as a menu on the login window.  This allows a user to select an
available session before logging in.

=item B<--default> I<DEFAULT>

Specifies the default X session (window manager) name that should be
used when no X session is selected by the user.  This default is fed as
an argument to F<~/.xinitrc>.

=item B<--username> I<USERNAME>

Specifies the default user name for login.

=item B<--nosetbg>

Specifies that the background image should not be set by the program.
The default behaviour is to set the background in accordance with the
B<-banner> option.

=item B<--transparent>

Specifies that the login panel should be transparent and that the
widgets should be embedded in the background image.  The default is to
paint the login panel.

=item B<-n>, B<--dry-run>

Specifies that the program should not perform any actions but should
simply print intentions to standard output.  This option is for testing.

=item B<-D>, B<--debug> [I<LEVEL>]

Increase, or set to I<LEVEL>, the debugging verbosity.  The default
debugging verbosity level is zero (0), which means to output no
debugging information.  When non-zero, debugging information will be
printed to standard error.

=item B<-v>, B<--verbose> [I<LEVEL>]

Increase, or set to I<LEVEL>, the output verbosity.  The default output
verbosity level is one (1), which means to output normal information to
standard output.  When set to zero (0), no output will be printed to
standard output. 

=back

=head1 EXIT STATUS

When run as a I<greeter> program, instead of communicating using a
socket, the I<greeter> program can provide further instructions to
L<xdm(8)> based on the exit status of the I<greeter> program.
Therefore, the program provides the exit status values as follows:

=over 4

=item 0 - B<OBEYSESS_DISPLAY>

Obey the multiple sessions resource.

=item 1 - B<REMANAGE_DISPLAY>

Force re-management of the display.

=item 2 - B<UNMANAGE_DISPLAY>

Force deletion of the display.

=item 3 - B<RESERVER_DISPLAY>

Force server termination.

=item 4 - B<OPENFAILED_DISPLAY>

L<XOpenDisplay(1x)> failed, retry.

=back

=head1 USAGE

=head1 X RESOURCES

Most values that affect the look and feel of B<xde-xchooser> may also be
specified as X resources in the B<RESOURCE_MANAGER> database associated
with the X server.  All of these resources can have the specific
resource name and class (C<xde-xchooser>, C<XDE-XChooser>).  When no resource
is found with the specific name and class, L<xdm(8)> resources with name
and class (C<chooser>, C<Chooser>) will also be examined for
specified resources.

Note that L<xdm(8)> usually adds the resources contained in the
F</etc/X11/xdm/Xresources> file that is loaded by L<xdm(8)> on startup
to the resource database on the X server.  Chooser resource defaults
(see also L<xdm(8)> and L<xde-xchooser(1)>) are contained in the
F</usr/share/X11/app-defaults/Chooser> file.  Likewise, B<xde-xchooser>
specific resource defaults are contained in the
F</usr/share/X11/app-defaults/XDE-XChooser> file, in accordance with the
convention of naming applications default files after their resource
class.  See also L</FILES>.

=head2 XDE CHOOSER RESOURCES

point depending on its gravity (currently static or centered).

=item B<xde-xchooser>.B<y>: I<DOUBLE>

Specifies the Y position on the monitor as a floating point number
between C<0.0> and C<1.0>, where C<0.0> represents the top edge of the

=item B<xlogin>.B<Login.innerFrameWidth>: I<INTEGER>

The width in pixels of the area around text input areas drawn in
B<hiColor> and B<shdColor>.
The default is C<2>.
For GTK, when set to C<0>, the text areas will be drawn flat; otherwise,
they will be drawn sunken.

=item B<xlogin>.B<Login.sepWidth>: I<INTEGER>

The width in pixels of the bezel line between the greeting and input
areas drawn in B<hiColor> and B<shdColor>.
For GTK, when set to C<0>, the line will be drawn flat; otherwise it
will be drawn etched.
The default is C<2>.

=item B<xlogin>.B<Login.allowRootLogin>: {B<true>|B<false>}

When set to C<false>, do not allow root (and any other user with uid of
zero) to log in directly.
This setting is only checked by some authentication back-ends at this
time.
The default is C<true>.
This option is better set using the C<xdm-login> PAM service settings.

=item B<xlogin>.B<Login.allowNullPasswd>: {B<true>|B<false>}

If set to C<true>, allow an otherwise failing password match to succeed
if the account does not require a password at all.  The default is
C<false>, so only users that have passwords assigned can log in.
This option is better set using the C<xdm-login> PAM service settings.

=item B<xlogin>.B<Login.echoPasswd>: {B<true>|B<false>}

When set C<true>, a placeholder character (B<echoPasswdChar>) will be
shown for fields normally set to not echo, such as password input.  The
L<xdm(8)> default is C<false>.
The default is C<true>.

=item B<xlogin>.B<Login.echoPasswdChar>: I<STRING>

Character to display if B<echoPasswd> is C<true>.  The default is C<*>.
When set to an empty value, the cursor will advance for each character
input, but no text will be drawn.

=item B<xlogin>.B<Login.borderWidth>: I<INTEGER>

The width in pixels between the edge of the greeter frame and its
content.
The default is C<3>.

=item B<xlogin>.B<Login.translations>: I<STRING>

This resource is not used by B<xde-xchooser>.

=head2 XDM DISPLAY MANAGER RESOURCES

There are also a number of L<xdm(8)> configuration resources that are
specific to L<xdm(8)> and documented in the L<xdm(8)> manual page.
B<xde-greeter> uses some of these resources to determine a number of
behaviors as follows:

=over 4

=item B<DisplayManager>.B<authDir>: I<STRING>

This names a directory under which L<xdm(8)> stores authorization files
while initializing the session.  The default value is
F</usr/lib/X11/xdm> (but should be F</var/lib/xdm>).

=item B<DisplayManager>.B<exportList>: I<STRING LIST>

A list of additional environment variables, separated by white space, to
pass on to the F<Xsetup>, F<Xstartup>, F<Xsession>, and F<Xreset>
programs.  This is in addition to the following environment variables:
C<DISPLAY>, C<HOME>, C<LOGNAME>, C<USER>, C<PATH>, C<SHELL>,
C<XAUTHORITY>, C<WINDOWPATH>, which are always exported to these
programs.



=back

=head2 XDM SERVER RESOURCES

L<xdm(8)> server resources can be specified on a per-display basis.
None of the resources is significant to the greeter or chooser.

=head2 XDM SESSION RESOURCES

L<xdm(8)> session resources can also be specified on a per-display
basis, if required.  Some of the resources are significant to the
greeter program as follows:

=over 4

=item B<DisplayManager>.I<DISPLAY>.B<authFile>: I<STRING>

This file is used to communicate the authorization data from L<xdm(8)>
to the server, using the B<-auth> server command line option.  It should
be kept in a directory which is not world-writable as it could easily be
removed, disabling the authorization mechanism in the server.  If not
specified, a name is generated from B<DisplayManager>.B<authDir> and the
name of the display.

=item B<DisplayManager>.I<DISPLAY>.B<setup>: I<STRING>

Specifies a program that is run (as root) before offering the login
window.  This may be used to change the appearance of the screen around
the login window or to put up other windows (e.g., you may want to run
F<xconsole> here).  By default, no program is run.  The conventional
name for a file used here is F<Xsetup>.  See L<xdm(8)/Setup Program>.

Note that when the B<DisplayManager>.I<DISPLAY>.B<greeter> program is
specified, this program is not run, even when defined: its purpose is to
provide additional tools for the built-in greeter library.

=item B<DisplayManager>.I<DISPLAY>.B<startup>: I<STRING>

This specifies a program that is run (as root) after the authentication
process succeeds.  By default, no program is run.  The conventional name
for a file user here is F<Xstartup>.  This program typically cleans up
after F<Xsetup> and registers the user session in F<utmp>/F<wtmp> with
the L<sessreg(1)> program.  Historically, it also released the console
(controlling terminal) to the user by changing ownership of the console
device, using a program named F<GiveConsole>.  See L<xdm(8)/Startup
Program>.

When the B<xlogin> program is responsible for completing the login and
launching the session, it may execute this file before creating the user
session.  However, the B<greeter> program is only responsible for
authenticating the user and, as a result, L<xdm(8)> will launch this
program before establishing the user session.
So, the B<greeter> can ignore this resource.

=item B<DisplayManager>.I<DISPLAY>.B<session>: I<STRING>

This specifies the session to be executed (not running as root).  By
default, F</usr/bin/xterm> is run.  The conventional name is
F<Xsession>.  This program is executed with a single argument,
C<failsafe>, when fail-safe operation is specified as part of the login
process.  The typical program recognizes this argument and simply
launches an L<xterm(1)> when it is detected.  Otherwise, this program
typically executes the user's F<$HOME/.xsession> file if it exists, and
otherwise the user's F<$HOME/.xinitrc> file if it exists; otherwise, it
typically executes the system F</etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc> file.  See
L<xdm(8)/Session Program>.

When the B<xlogin> program is responsible for completing the login and
launching the session, it may execute this file after creating the user
session.  However, the B<greeter> program is only responsible for
authenticating the user and, as a result, L<xdm(8)> will launch this
program after establishing the user session.
So, the B<greeter> can ignore this resource.

=item B<DisplayManager>.I<DISPLAY>.B<reset>: I<STRING>

This specifies a program that is run (as root) after the session
terminates.  By default, no program is run.  The conventional name is
F<Xreset>.  This program typically removes the user session from
F<utmp>/F<wtmp> with the L<sessreg(1)> program.  Historically, it also
removed the console (controlling terminal) from the user by restoring
ownership of the console device, using a program called F<TakeConsole>.
See L<xdm(8)>/Reset Program>.

When the B<xlogin> program is responsible for completing the login and
launching the session, it may execute this file after the user session
ends.  However, the B<greeter> program is only responsible for
authenticating the user and, as a result, L<xdm(8)> will launch this
program after the user session ends.
So, the B<greeter> can ignore this resource.

=item B<DisplayManager>.I<DISPLAY>.B<userPath>: I<STRING>

L<xdm(8)> sets the C<PATH> environment variable for the session to this
value.  It should be a colon separated list of directories: see L<sh(1)>
for a full description.  The default value is
F</bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/ucb>.

Note that a more modern entry is F</sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin>.  An
B<xlogin> program should observe this resource by setting the C<PATH>
environment variable to its value when opening the user session and when
running the F<Xsession> script.  The B<greeter> can ignore this resource.

=item B<DisplayManager>.I<DISPLAY>.B<systemPath>: I<STRING>

L<xdm(8)> sets the C<PATH> environment variable for the startup and
reset scripts (run as root) to the value of this resource.  The default
for this resource is F</etc:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/ucb>.  Note the
absence of C<.> from this entry.  This is a good practice to follow for
root; it avoids many common Trojan Horse system penetration schemes.

Note that a more modern entry is F</sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin>.  An
B<xlogin> program should observe this resource by setting the C<PATH>
environment variable to its value when running the
F<Xstartup> and F<Xreset> scripts.
The B<greeter> can ignore this resource.

=item B<DisplayManager>.I<DISPLAY>.B<systemShell>: I<STRING>

L<xdm(8)> sets the C<SHELL> environment variable for the startup and
reset scripts to the value of this resource.  It is F</bin/sh> by
default.

An B<xlogin> program should observe this resource by using its setting
when launching the F<Xstartup> and F<Xreset> programs.
The B<greeter> can ignore this resource.

=item B<DisplayManager>.I<DISPLAY>.B<failsafeClient>: I<STRING>

If the default session fails to execute, L<xdm(8)> will fall back to
this program.  This program is executed with no arguments, but executes
using the same environment variables as the session would have had (see
L<xdm(8)/Session Program>).  By default, F</usr/bin/xterm> is used.
Note that L<twm(1)> or L<failsafewm(1)> are good choices over the
traditional L<xterm(1)>.

An B<xlogin> program can choose and execute it's own fail-safe
mechanism.  The B<greeter> can ignore this resource as it will be the
responsibility of L<xdm(8)> to invoke fail-safe operation.

=item B<DisplayManager>.I<DISPLAY>.B<grabServer>: I<BOOLEAN>

=item B<DisplayManager>.I<DISPLAY>.B<grabTimeout>: I<INTEGER>

To improve security, L<xdm(8)> grabs the server and keyboard while
reading the login name and password.  The B<grabServer> resource
specifies if the server should be held for the duration of the
name/password reading.  When C<false>, the server is ungrabbed after the
keyboard grab succeeds, otherwise the server is grabbed until just
before the session begins.  The default is C<false>.  The B<grabTimeout>
resource specifies the maximum time L<xdm(8)> will wait for the grab to
succeed.  The grab may fail if some other client has the server grabbed,
or possibly if the network latencies are very high.  This resources has
a default value of 3 seconds; you should be cautious when raising it, as
a user can be spoofed by a look-alike window on the display.  If the
grab fails, L<xdm(8)> kills and restarts the server (if possible) and
the session.

Both an B<xlogin> and B<greeter> program should observe these resources
by providing the same behaviour.

=item B<DisplayManager>.I<DISPLAY>.B<authorize>: I<BOOLEAN>

=item B<DisplayManager>.I<DISPLAY>.B<authName>: I<STRINGLIST>

B<authorize> is a boolean resource that controls whether L<xdm(8)>
generates and uses authorization for local server connections.  If
authorization is used, B<authName> is a list of authorization mechanisms
to use, separated by white space.  XDMCP connections dynamically specify
which authorization mechanisms are supported, so B<authName> is ignored
in this case.  When B<authorize> is set for a display and authorization
is not available, the user is informed by having a different message
display in the login widget.  By default, B<authorize> is C<true>,
B<authName> is C<MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1> or if C<XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1> is
available, C<XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1>.

This resource can be ignored by B<xlogin> and B<greeter> programs, as
there are other mechanisms to determine whether authorization has be
applied to the display server.

=item B<DisplayManager>.I<DISPLAY>.B<authComplain>: I<BOOLEAN>

If set to C<false>, disables the use of the B<unsecureGreeting> in the
login window.  See L<xdm(8)/Authentication Widget>.  The default is
C<true>.

An B<xlogin> and B<greeter> program should observe this resource by
complaining about lack of authorization when detected and presenting the
B<xlogin>.B<Login>.B<unsecureGreeting> string when lacking.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION

L<xdm(8)> specifies which chooser and greeter to execute in its
configuration file F</usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config>:

=over 4

=item B<DisplayManager>.I<DISPLAY>.B<chooser>

This option, described in L<xdm(8)>, is used to tell L<xdm(8)> which
program to run as a chooser.  This should be set to
F</usr/lib/X11/xdm/xde-xchooser>.  See L<xde-xchooser(1)> and
L<xdm(8)/CHOOSER>.

=item B<DisplayManager>.I<DISPLAY>.B<greeter>

This option, described in L<xdm(8)>, is used to tell L<xdm(8)> which
program to run as a greeter.  This should be set to
F</usr/lib/X11/xdm/xde-greeter>.  See L<xde-greeter(1)> and
L<xdm(8)/AUTHENTICATION WIDGET>.

=item B<DisplayManager>.I<DISPLAY>.B<xlogin>

This option, described in L<xdm(8)>, is used to tell L<xdm(8)> which
program to run for login.  This should be set to
F</usr/lib/X11/xdm/xde-xlogin>.  See L<xde-xlogin(1)> and
L<xdm(8)/AUTHENTICATION WIDGET>.

=back

=head1 FILES

The following files are used by the program:

=over 4

=item F</usr/lib/X11/xdm/xde-xchooser>

The default location of the B<xde-xchooser> executable.
As this is not useful for normal users, it does not reside in the
F</usr/bin> directory.

=item F</usr/lib/X11/xdm/banner.png>

The default location of the banner graphic.

=item F<$XDG_DATA_DIRS/images/${XDG_MENU_PREFIX}splash.png>

The default location of the background splash to display on the
screen when no other background is available.

=item F</etc/X11/xdm/Xresources>

The normal location of the X resources file for L<xdm(8)>.  Normally,
L<xdm(8)> will merge the resources found in this file into the X display
B<RESOURCE_MANAGER> property on the root window before launching the
greeter or chooser programs.

=item F</etc/X11/xdm/xde/Xresources>

Because the greeter and chooser is associated with XDE, a complete set of
L<xdm(8)> configuration files, including the X resources file containing
B<XDE-XChooser> resources are contained in the F</etc/X11/xdm/xde>
subdirectory.  Application defaults are not loaded from anywhere else
for security.

=item F</usr/share/X11/app-defaults/XDE-XChooser>

X resource defaults for B<xde-xchooser>.
The program will load the default resources from this file and then
merge the resources specified in the B<RESOURCE_MANAGER> property on the
X display.  L<xdm(8)> will normally use L<xrdb(1)> to merge the
resources from the F</etc/X11/xdm/Xresources> into the
B<RESOURCE_MANAGER> property on the X display before launching the login
or greeter program.

=back

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

The following environment variables are considered by the program:

=over 4

=item B<XDG_VENDOR_ID>

When specified in the environment, the program will use the value of
this environment variable to form the default names of the B<--banner>
and B<--splash> files by prefixing it and a dash (C<->) to the default
banner or splash name.  This environment variable will be used in
preference to B<XDG_MENU_PREFIX> but can be overridden with the
B<--vendor> option.

=item B<XDG_MENU_PREFIX>

When specified in the environment, and neither the B<XDG_VENDOR_ID>
environment variable nor the B<--vendor> option are specified, the
program will use the value of this environment variable to form the
default names of the B<--banner> and B<--splash> files by prefixing it
to the default banner or splash name.  This environment variable will be
overridden by either of the B<XDG_VENDOR_ID> environment variable or
B<--vendor> option.

=item B<XDG_DATA_DIRS>

When specified, specifies the path of XDG data directories that will be
searched for banner or splash files.  When unspecified, defaults to
F</usr/local/share:/usr/share> in accordance with XDG specifications.

=back

=head1 BUGS

B<xde-xchooser> had no known bugs at the time of release.  Please report
bugs for current versions to the source code repository at
L<https://github.com/bbidulock/xde-session/issues>.

=head1 HISTORY

This program was originally written as a GTK2-perl script, but I don't
like running GTK2-perl scripts as root, do you?  Also, I wanted to
permit the program to redirect a user X session, or to redirect a Xephyr
session, and this close interaction with the X server was not available
in perl.  You can check out the original perl version at
L<http://github.com/bbidulock/gchooser>.

Historically, L<xdm(8)> has provided a I<greeter> and a I<chooser>.  The
I<greeter> was a graphical login program that was integrated with
L<xdm(8)>.  The I<chooser> was a graphical XDCMP chooser program that,
while part of the XDM distribution, was a separate program launched by
L<xdm(8)>.  Both of these programs used the archaic Athena widget set.

The XDE fork of L<xdm(8)> provides for a separate I<greeter> program to
be used for graphical login.  Originally, XDE used a modified version of
the L<slim(1)> login manager to act also as a I<greeter> for L<xdm(8)>.
A I<chooser> program was written using perl-gtk2 to act as a much nicer
looking and more fully IPv6 functional I<chooser> program.

This then begged the question as to why there needed to be a separate
I<greeter> and I<chooser>.  Why should not the user be able to login to
the local machine, or choose to login to a remote machine instead.
After all, choosing the local machine from the I<greeter> functions
similar to a I<greeter>.

L<slim(1)> took the approach that logging into an X server is not that
terribly different to unlocking a screen saver.  Why should not the same
appearance code be used for both.  This led XDE to use a related
program, L<xde-xlock(1)> to provide the screen locking mechanism for XDE
in the same fashion as the display manager programs.

Traditional display managers for Linux, such as L<gdm(1)>, have also
taken the approach that choosing an X session (well, at least an
C<XSession> F<.desktop> file to run) could also be performed during
login, instead of selecting one after the login process.
