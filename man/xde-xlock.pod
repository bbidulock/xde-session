=head1 NAME

xde-xlock - screen locker for X Desktop Environment (XDE)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<xde-xlock> [I<OPTIONS>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<xde-xlock> is a screen locker replacement that provides tight
integration with the L<systemd(8)> multi-session environment.  It acts as
a screen-saver locker, detects L<logind(8)> C<Lock> signals, and
performs locking on VT switches.

=head1 OPTIONS

No options are necessary.  When launched by L<xdm(8)>, it will provide
the appropriate arguments.  B<xde-xlock> can be launched directly on
the command line of an x-terminal to test its appearance and operation.
In this mode, arguments are still required but no options.  Absence of
the B<-xdmAddress>, B<-clientAddress> and B<-connectionType> options
indicates to B<xde-xlock> that it was not launched by L<xdm(8)> or an
L<xdm(8)> work-alike as a chooser.  See L</USAGE> for more information.

=head2 COMMAND OPTIONS

Command options affect the major operating mode of the program.  Only
one command option may be specified (with the exception that B<--help>
can be specified in conjunction with any other command option).
When no command option is specified, B<--locker> is assumed.
The command options recognized by the program are as follows:

=over 4

=item [B<-L>, B<--locker>]

Run continuously as a screen locker instance.  This process will monitor
for screen locking requests, screen saver activation and virtual
terminal changes and will invoke screen locking as appropriate.

=item B<-r>, B<--replace>

Replace a currently running screen locker instance with the current
process.

=item B<-l>, B<--lock>

Ask a running instance to lock the screen now.

=item B<-q>, B<--quit>

Ask a running instance to exit.

=item B<-H>, B<-help>

Instead of operating normally, the program prints usage information to
standard output and exits.

=item B<-V>, B<--version>

Instead of operating normally, the program prints detailed version
information and exits.

=item B<-C>, B<--copying>

Instead of operating normally, the program prints detailed copying
permissions and exits.

=back

=head2 GENERAL OPTIONS

B<xde-xlock> provides a set of general options that are not supported
by the L<xdm(8)> greeter or chooser.  To supply these options requires
an intermediate script that specifies them and echoes the L<xdm(8)>
chooser options.  So that an intermediate script is not necessary,
L<xdm(8)> provides an F<Xresources> files containing X resources that
are used instead of command line options to tailor the look and feel of
the greeter and chooser.  As a result, the use of the following command
line options are not necessary and are really only used for testing.

The following are the more general options:

=over 4

=item B<-p>, B<--prompt> I<MARKUP>

Specifies the F<pango> markup text that is to be displayed in the title
area of the panel.
When unspecified, the default welcome text is C<Welcome to %s!>, where C<%s>
is the fully qualified domain name of the local host.

As with the B<-banner> option, this option can easily be supplied by a
shell script between L<xdm(8)> and B<xde-xlock> that adds the
options:

 #!/bin/sh
 /usr/bin/xde-xlock -prompt "Welcome to X!" \
         -banner /usr/lib/X11/xdm/banner.png $@

=item B<-b>, B<--banner> I<BANNER>

Specifies the banner graphic to display in the left pane of the panel.
L<xdm(8)> does not provide this option, but it can easily be
invoked by a shell script invoked by L<xdm(8)> that adds the options.
For example:

 #!/bin/sh
 /usr/bin/xde-xlock -banner /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xde/banner.png $@

The default is obtained by looking for the file
F<${XDG_MENU_PREFIX}banner.{xpm,png,jpg,svg}> in the F<images>
subdirectory of standard XDG data directories, F<$XDG_DATA_DIRS>.  See
L</ENVIRONMENT>.

=item B<-S>, B<--splash> I<SPLASH>

Specifies the background image, I<SPLASH>, to display on the screen.
The default is to use the background image currently installed on the
screen, and if no background image is installed on the screen, to search
for the background image file in the file named
F<${XDG_MENU_PREFIX}splash.{xpm,png,jpg,svg}> in the F<images>
subdirectory of standard XDG data directories, F<$XDG_DATA_DIRS>.  See
L</ENVIRONMENT>.

L<xdm(8)> does not provide this option, but it can easily be
invoked by a shell script by L<xdm(8)> that adds the options.  For
example:

 #!/bin/sh
 /usr/bin/xde-xlock -splash /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xde/splash.jpg $@

=item B<-s>, B<--side> {B<left>|B<top>|B<right>|B<bottom>}

Specifies the side on which to display branding (the banner graphic).

the default is I<left>.

=item B<-n>, B<--noask>

=item B<--charset> I<CHARSET>

Specifies the character set to use.  When unspecified, the character
set is determined using the current locale: see L<locale(7)>.

=item B<--language> I<LANGUAGE>

Specifies the language to use.  When unspecified, the language is
determined using the current locale: see L<locale(7)>.

=item B<-i>, B<--icons> I<ICON-THEME>

Specifies the GTK+ icon theme to use.  When unspecified, the icon theme
is automatically determined using desktop and toolkit files.

=item B<-e>, B<--theme> I<GTK2-THEME>

Specifies the GTK+ theme name to use.  When unspecified, the GTK2 theme
is automatically determined using desktop and toolkit files.

=item B<-u>, B<--xde-theme>

Specifies that the GTK+ icon theme and theme name to be used are those
of the X Desktop Environment (XDE) rather than the system default theme.
The default is to specify this flag.

=item B<-T>, B<--timeout> I<TIMEOUT>

=item B<--vendor> I<VENDOR>

Specifies the vendor identifier for branding.  The default, when
unspecified, is to used the value of environment variables
B<XDG_VENDOR_ID> and B<XDG_MENU_PREFIX> to determine the vendor name and
prefix.

=item B<-X>, B<--xsessions>

Specifies that available X sessions (window managers) should be provided
as a menu on the login window.  This allows a user to select an
available session before logging in.

=item B<--default> I<DEFAULT>

Specifies the default X session (window manager) name that should be
used when no X session is selected by the user.  This default is fed as
an argument to F<~/.xinitrc>.

paint the login panel.

=item B<-y>, B<--tray>

Specifies that a status icon for the locker should be placed in the
system tray.

=item B<-n>, B<--dry-run>

Specifies that the program should not perform any actions but should
simply print intentions to standard output.  This option is for testing.

=item B<-D>, B<--debug> [I<LEVEL>]

Increase, or set to I<LEVEL>, the debugging verbosity.  The default
debugging verbosity level is zero (0), which means to output no
debugging information.  When non-zero, debugging information will be
printed to standard error.

=item B<-v>, B<--verbose> [I<LEVEL>]

Increase, or set to I<LEVEL>, the output verbosity.  The default output
verbosity level is one (1), which means to output normal information to
standard output.  When set to zero (0), no output will be printed to
standard output. 

=back

=head1 USAGE

The B<--locker> command option (the default), or the B<--replace>
option, can be used to run the program as a background screen locker.
In this mode the program installs itself as follows:

=over 4

=item 1.

If possible, takes ownership of the B<_XDE_XLOCK_S>C<%d> manager
selections for each screen on the display.  If one of these manager
selections is already owned, the program exits with a diagnostic unless
B<--replace> was specified as a command option.

=item 2.

Installs itself as a screen saver using the C<MIT-SCREEN-SAVER>
extension on the X server (if present).

=item 3.

Installs itself as a monitoring program on the controlling terminal for
virtual terminal switches (when the X server is running on a local
virtual terminal).

=item 4.

Listens for a C<Lock> signal from the L<systemd(8)> L<logind(8)>
D-BUS service.

=item 5.

Installs itself in the system tray when the B<--tray> option is
specified.

=item 6.

Monitors for changes.

=back

When monitoring for changes, the screen locker responds as follows:

=over 4

=item 1.

When it receives a lock request from another instance of the program, it
locks the screen immediately.

=item 2.

When the screen saver is activated, it waits for a number of seconds
after the activation and locks the screen.

=item 3.

When a C<Lock> signal is received from L<logind(8)>, over the D-BUS, it
locks the screen.

When an C<Unlock> signal is received from L<logind(8)>, over the D-BUS,
it unlocks the screen.

=item 4.

When a virtual terminal change is made to the VT on which the X server
is running, it locks the screen before permitting the switch.

=back

The B<--quit> option can be used to ask a running instance of the screen
locker to quit (remove itself and exit).

The B<--lock> option can be used to ask a running instance of the screen
locker to lock the screen.

=head2 SYSTEM TRAY

When installed in the system tray using the B<--tray> option, the
program provides system tray access to a lock menu, configuration menu,
and a X session switcher.  The lock menu provides the ability to lock
the screen from the system tray by left-clicking the lock icon or
right-clicking the icon and selecting the lock from the menu.  The X
session switch provides an X session switcher that can perform VT
switches on the local host.  This menu is also available from the lock
screen.  A configuration menu is also available to manage the options
associated with the program and contained in the user's resource file.

=head2 LOCKING

To permit a flexible locking policy, locking under the following
conditions can be activated or deactivated:

=over 4

=item B<VT switches>

Switches between virtual terminals (any users).

=item B<VT switches between users>

Switches between virtual terminals where the users of the switched-from
and switched-to virtual terminals are different.

=item B<Screen saver timeouts>

When the screen saver is activated.

=item B<systemd lock signals>

When a C<Lock> signal is received from L<systemd(1)>.

=item B<Inactivity timeout>

When user input has been inactive for a given period of time.

=back


=head1 X RESOURCES

Most values that affect the look and feel of B<xde-xlock> may also be
specified as X resources in the B<RESOURCE_MANAGER> database associated
with the X server.  All of these resources can have the specific
resource name and class (C<xde-xlock>, B<XDE-XLock>).  When no resource
is found with the specific name and class, L<xdm(8)> resources with name
and class (C<xlogin.login>, C<Xlogin.login>) will also be examined for
specified resources.

Note that L<xdm(8)> usually adds the resources contained in the
F</etc/X11/xdm/Xresources> file that is loaded by L<xdm(8)> on startup
to the resource database on the X server.  Chooser resource defaults
(see also L<xdm(8)> and L<xde-xchooser(1)>) are contained in the
F</usr/share/X11/app-defaults/Chooser> file.  Likewise, B<xde-xlock>
specific resource defaults are contained in the
F</usr/share/X11/app-defaults/XDE-XLock> file, in accordance with the
convention of naming applications default files after their resource
class.  See also L</FILES>.

B<xde-xlock> observes the following X11 Resource Manager resources when
loaded by L<xdm(8)> prior to execution:

=over 4

=item B<xde-xlock>.B<x>: I<DOUBLE>

Specifies the X position on the monitor as a floating point number
between C<0.0> and C<1.0>, where C<0.0> represents the left edge of the
monitor and C<1.0>, the right edge.  The dialog will be positioned on this
point depending on its gravity (currently static or centered).

=item B<xde-xlock>.B<y>: I<DOUBLE>

Specifies the Y position on the monitor as a floating point number
between C<0.0> and C<1.0>, where C<0.0> represents the top edge of the
monitor and C<1.0>, the bottom edge.  The dialog will be positioned on
this point depending on its gravity (currently static or centered).

The default is C<2>.

=item B<xlogin>.B<Login.allowRootLogin>: {B<true>|B<false>}

When set to C<false>, do not allow root (and any other user with uid of
zero) to log in directly.
This setting is only checked by some authentication back-ends at this
time.
The default is C<true>.
This option is better set using the C<xdm-login> PAM service settings.

=item B<xlogin>.B<Login.allowNullPasswd>: {B<true>|B<false>}

If set to C<true>, allow an otherwise failing password match to succeed
if the account does not require a password at all.  The default is
C<false>, so only users that have passwords assigned can log in.
This option is better set using the C<xdm-login> PAM service settings.

=item B<xlogin>.B<Login.echoPasswd>: {B<true>|B<false>}

When set C<true>, a placeholder character (B<echoPasswdChar>) will be
shown for fields normally set to not echo, such as password input.  The
L<xdm(8)> default is C<false>.
The default is C<true>.

=item B<xlogin>.B<Login.echoPasswdChar>: I<STRING>

Character to display if B<echoPasswd> is C<true>.  The default is C<*>.
When set to an empty value, the cursor will advance for each character
input, but no text will be drawn.

=item B<xlogin>.B<Login.borderWidth>: I<INTEGER>

The width in pixels between the edge of the greeter frame and its
content.
The default is C<3>.

=item B<xlogin>.B<Login.translations>: I<STRING>

This resource not used by B<xde-xlock>.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION

L<xdm(8)> specifies which chooser and greeter to execute in its
configuration file F</usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config>:

=over 4

=item B<DisplayManager>.I<DISPLAY>.B<chooser>

This option, described in L<xdm(8)>, is used to tell L<xdm(8)> which
program to run as a chooser.  This should be set to
F</usr/bin/xde-xlock>.  See L<xdm(8)/CHOOSER>.

=item B<DisplayManager>.I<DISPLAY>.B<greeter>

This option, described in L<xdm(8)>, is used to tell L<xdm(8)> which
program to run as a greeter.  This should be set to
F</usr/bin/xde-xlock>.  See L<xdm(8)/AUTHENTICATION WIDGET>.

=back

=head1 SOUND EVENTS

B<xde-xlock> plays the following event sounds:

=over

=item C<desktop-screen-lock>

This sound is played when the screen is locked, but is cancelled when
the screen lock has been cancelled before timeout.

=item C<desktop-screen-unlock>

This sound is played when the screen is unlocked, but not when a screen
lock is cancelled before the timeout.

=back

=head1 FILES

The following files are used by the program:

=over 4

=item F</usr/bin/xde-xlock>

The default location of the B<xde-xlock> executable.
As this is useful for normal users, it resides in the
F</usr/bin> directory.

=item F<$XDG_DATA_DIRS/images/${XDG_MENU_PREFIX}banner.png>

The default location of the banner graphic.

=item F<$XDG_DATA_DIRS/images/${XDG_MENU_PREFIX}splash.png>

The default location of the background splash to display on the lock
screen when no other background is available.

=item F</etc/X11/xdm/Xresources>

The normal location of the X resources file for L<xdm(8)>.  Normally,
L<xdm(8)> will merge the resources found in this file into the X display
B<RESOURCE_MANAGER> property on the root window before launching the
greeter or chooser programs.

=item F</etc/X11/xdm/xde/Xresources>

Because the greeter and chooser is associated with XDE, a complete set of
L<xdm(8)> configuration files, including the X resources file containing
B<XDE-XLock> resources are contained in the F</etc/X11/xdm/xde>
subdirectory.  Application defaults are not loaded from anywhere else
for security.

=item F</usr/share/X11/app-defaults/XDE-XLock>

X resource defaults for B<xde-xlock>.
The program will load the default resources from this file and then
merge the resources specified in the B<RESOURCE_MANAGER> property on the
X display.  L<xdm(8)> will normally use L<xrdb(1)> to merge the
resources from the F</etc/X11/xdm/Xresources> into the
B<RESOURCE_MANAGER> property on the X display before launching the login
or greeter program.

=back

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

The following environment variables are considered by the program:

=over 4

=item B<XDG_VENDOR_ID>

When specified in the environment, the program will use the value of
this environment variable to form the default names of the B<--banner>
and B<--splash> files by prefixing it and a dash (C<->) to the default
banner or splash name.  This environment variable will be used in
preference to B<XDG_MENU_PREFIX> but can be overridden with the
B<--vendor> option.

=item B<XDG_MENU_PREFIX>

When specified in the environment, and neither the B<XDG_VENDOR_ID>
environment variable nor the B<--vendor> option are specified, the
program will use the value of this environment variable to form the
default names of the B<--banner> and B<--splash> files by prefixing it
to the default banner or splash name.  This environment variable will be
overridden by either of the B<XDG_VENDOR_ID> environment variable or
B<--vendor> option.

=item B<XDG_DATA_DIRS>

When specified, specifies the path of XDG data directories that will be
searched for banner or splash files.  When unspecified, defaults to
F</usr/local/share:/usr/share> in accordance with XDG specifications.

=head1 BUGS

B<xde-xlock> had no known bugs at the time of release.  Please report
bugs for current versions to the source code repository at
L<https://github.com/bbidulock/xde-session/issues>.

=head1 HISTORY

I wrote B<xde-xlock> because there were no stand-alone screen lockers
that worked well with the L<systemd(8)> multi-session environment.
