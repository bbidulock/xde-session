=head1 NAME

xde-chooser -- choose an XDG desktop session to execute

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<xde-chooser> [I<OPTIONS>] [I<SESSION>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<xde-chooser> is a C<C>-language program that can be launched from
F<~/.xinitrc> to choose the X session that will be launched, or can be
launched from a window manager or session logout script to switch the
sessions.  The menu can also provide the choice for the user to perform
actions on the box such as powering off the computer, restarting the
computer, etc.

When a selection is made or logout/disconnect is selected,
B<xde-chooser> prints the selected session name (or filename to the
xsession desktop file when B<-f> is given) or the special name C<logout>
to standard output and exits with a zero exit status.  On error, a
diagnostic message is printed to standard error and a non-zero exit
status is returned.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

B<xde-chooser> accepts one optional argument as follows:

=over

=item [I<SESSION>]

The name of the XDG session to use.  This can be any of the recognized
session names or the special names: C<logout>, C<default> or C<choose>.

=over

=item C<logout>

Do not choose a session but simply logout.  This has the effect of
simply reprinting C<logout> to standard output and exiting.

=item C<default>

Do not choose a session but simply run (typically without prompting)
whichever session the user has set as a default.  (The default is
located in the file F<$HOME/.dmrc> or F<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xde/default>.)
When no default is configured, or when the configured default is not
usable (e.g.  missing executable), this argument has the same effect as
C<choose>, below.

=item C<choose>

Launch a dialog to choose the session regardless of whether a default
session is configured or available.  This is the most typical mode of
B<xde-chooser>.

=item I<SESSION>

A Session name is the name of the F<*.desktop> file (without the
F<.desktop> suffix) that exists in a F<@XDG_DATA_DIRS/xsessions/>
subdirectory describing the window manager session.  Some commonly
recognized session names are as follows: C<adwm>, C<AfterStep>,
C<blackbox>, C<ctwm>, C<dwm>, C<etwm>, C<fluxbox>, C<flwm>, C<Fvwm>,
C<fvwm>, C<Fvwm1>, C<icewm>, C<jwm>, C<openbox>, C<pekwm>, C<twm>,
C<vtwm>, C<wmaker>, C<wmii>, C<wmx>, etc.

=back

When unspecified, the default is C<default>.

=back

=head1 OPTIONS

B<xde-chooser> uses L<getopt_long_only(3)> to parse options, so
abbreviated or single-dash long options are recognized when not
ambiguous.  B<xde-chooser> accepts the following options:

=head2 COMMAND OPTIONS

The following command options are mutually exclusive: the first option
in this group encountered sets the mode of the program.  When no command
option is specified, the program assumes normal operation.  In normal
operation the graphical chooser is display and once the user has
selected a session, the program exits.

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>

Print usage information to standard error containing current defaults
and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Print the program version to standard output and exit.

=item B<--copying>, B<-C>

Print copying permissions to standard output and exit.

=back

=head2 GENERAL OPTIONS

The following general options can be used with most of the command
options listed above:

=over

=item B<--display> I<DISPLAY>

Specifies the display to use.  This is not normally necessary as the
display is obtained from the B<DISPLAY> environment variable when this
option is not specified.

=item B<--filename>

When a user session is selected, output the full path filename to the
xsessions desktop file instead of just the appid corresponding to the
file.  This is useful for passing the full filename to a session manager
such as L<xde-session(1)>.

=item B<--default>, B<-d>

When a I<SESSION> is specified, also set the future default to I<SESSION>.

=item B<--prompt>, B<-p>

Prompt the user for the session regardless of the value of the
I<SESSION> argument.

=item B<--noask>, B<-n>

Do not ask the user whether she wishes to set the current session as the
default session when I<SESSION> is specified or chosen as something
different than the current default.

=item B<--timeout>, B<-T> I<SECONDS>

Specify the timeout in seconds that the program will wait for user input
before proceeding with the default session.  Set to zero to defeat the
timeout altogether.  The default is 15 seconds.

=item B<--charset>, B<-c> I<CHARSET>

Specify the character set with which to output the menu.  Defaults to
the character set in use by the current locale.
Because B<xde-chooser> is intended on running after the login, use of
this option is seldom necessary.

=item B<--language>, B<-l> I<LANGUAGE>

Specify the output language for the menu.  Defaults to the language set
in the current locale.
Because B<xde-chooser> is intended on running after the login, use of
this option is seldom necessary.

=item B<--banner>, B<-b> I<BANNER>

Specifies a custom login logo.  When unspecified, B<xde-chooser> will
use a branded logo that depends on environment variables.  This option
is compatible with L<xde-logout(1)>.

=item B<--side>, B<-s> {B<left>|B<top>|B<right>|B<bottom>}

Specifies the side of the window on which the logo will be placed.  This
option is recognized for compatibility with L<lxsession-logout(1)>.
B<xde-logout> always places the logo on the left and this option is
ignored.

=item B<--icons>, B<-i> I<THEME>

Specifies the icon theme to use.  Otherwise, the user's default gtk2
icon theme will be used (i.e. from F<$HOME/.gtkrc-2.0>); but note the
B<--xde-theme> option as well.

=item B<--theme>, B<-t> I<THEME>

Specifies the Gtk2 theme to use.  Otherwise, the user's default gtk2
theme will be used (i.e. from F<$HOME/.gtkrc-2.0>); but note the
B<--xde-theme> option as well.

=item B<--exec>, B<-e>

Execute the C<Exec=> action from the xsessions F<.desktop> file instead
of returning a string indicating the selected xsession.

(Note that the program actually executes C<xdg-launch -x I<SESSION>>
instead of determining how to execute the desktop file itself. See
L<xdg-launch(1)>.)

=item B<--xde-theme>, B<-x>

Use the current XDE desktop theme for the selection window instead of
the specified or default GTK theme.

=item B<--dry-run>, B<-N>

Do not do anything (do not execute or write out files), just print to
standard error what would be done.  Implies a debug level of C<2>.

=item B<--debug>, B<-D> [I<LEVEL>]

Increment or set the debug level to I<LEVEL>.  The default debugging
level is C<0> (meaning no debugging).  When set, the program will print
debuggin information to standard error during operation.

(Note that because this option takes an optional argument, C<--> must be
specified before any non-option argument.)

=item B<--verbose>, B<-v> [I<LEVEL>]

Increment or set the output verbosity level to I<LEVEL>.  The default
output verbosity level is C<1>.

(Note that because this option takes an optional argument, C<--> must be
specified before any non-option argument.)

=back

=head1 USAGE

B<xde-chooser> can be run from the command line to check its operation
without having to be involved in an session or started by L<xinit(1)>.
The B<--dry-run> option is usedful in combination with B<--exec> to keep
the chooser from attempting to execute the window manager.

B<xde-chooser> can also be run as a desktop application to switch the
window manager currently being used (this is because L<xdg-launch> with
the B<-x> flag is capable of switching the running window manager in
many cases).  Simply run it with the B<--exec> option.  An application
F<.desktop> file is distributed with the release to provide a menu item
for this funcion of the program.

(Note that switching the window manager may fail when L<xdg-launch>
cannot determine how to stop a running window manager when the running
window manager does not conform to ICCCM 2.0 C<WM_S0> manager selection
semantics.)

=head1 WINDOW MANAGERS

The I<XDE> suite ships with a number of session files that are contained
in the F</usr/share/xde/xsessions> directory.  Currently these are:
F<AfterStep>, F<blackbox>, F<fluxbox>, F<Fvwm1>, F<fvwm-crystal>,
F<Fvwm>, F<fvwm>, F<gnome>, F<icewm-session>, F<Jwm>, F<LXDE>,
F<openbox>, F<openbox-gnome>, F<openbox-kde>, F<pekwm>, F<ssh>, F<twm>,
F<wmaker>, F<wmii>, F<xfce>.

=head1 FILES

=over

=item F<$HOME/.dmrc>

This file contains the default session in the C<Session=> key of the
C<[Desktop]> section.  This file will be written whenever a new
default is chosen.  It will be read in preference to the
F<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xde/default> file.

=item F<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xde/default>

This file contains the default session.  The file consists of a single
line containing the session name.
Remember that the session name is the name of the F<.desktop> file
without the C<.desktop> suffix.

=item F<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xde/current>

This file contains the current session.  The file consists of a single
line containing the session name.
Remember that the session name is the name of the F<.desktop> file
without the C<.desktop> suffix.

=item F<@XDG_DATA_DIRS/xsessions/*.desktop>

These locations are searched for F<.desktop> files that describe which X
Sessions are to be made available to the user.  Files in this directory
can be desktop files of type B<Application> or B<XSession>.  A B<Window
Manager> section may also describe whether the session needs to be
managed or whether the window manager is capable of managing its own
session.  Desktop entry files in data directories earlier in the search
path override desktop entry files of the same filename later in the
search path.

The I<XDE> suite ships with a number of F<*.desktop> files that are
installed into the F</usr/share/xde/xsessions> directory and are used to
override those for I<gdm> that are normally contained in
F</usr/share/xsessions>.  (To do this, B<xde-chooser> prepends the path
F</usr/share/xde> to the B<XDG_DATA_DIRS> environment variable.)

For a set of these window managers, B<xde-chooser> will execute
L<xde-startup(1)> with the session as an argument.  See
L<xde-startup(1)/WINDOW MANAGERS> for a list of supported window
managers.

=back

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

The following environment variables (in alphabetical order) are examined
or set by B<xde-chooser>:

=over

=item B<DESKTOP_STARTUP_ID>

B<xde-chooser> is a GTK program and has been configured to automatically
perform startup notification completion on startup (not that anyone is
listening at this point).

=item B<DISPLAY>

Used to determine X Display.  When the B<--display> option is specified,
this environment variable will be set to the specified value.

=item B<FBXDG_DE>

To emulate L<fbautostart>, the C<FBXDG_DE> environment variable is
examined when the C<--desktop> option is not specified and the
C<XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP> environment variable is not set.  C<FBXDG_DE> is
set to the value that resulted from option and environment variable
processing for children of the session.

=item B<HOME>

Will be used to determine the user's home directory for the purpose of
calculating the default value for C<XDG_CONFIG_HOME> and
C<XDG_DATA_HOME> when required.  When unspecified, the home directory
for the current local user is determined from the password file.
Failing that, the current directory is used.

=item B<HOSTNAME>

Will be used to determine the local host name.  When unspecified, the
name will be determined from the L<gethostname(3)> call.  This value is
used to determine the host for which to save session files.  Also, will
be used to determine the default directory for some configuration and
commands.

=item B<LANG>

Used to set the current locale.

=item B<USER>

Will be used to determine the name of the local user.  When unspecified,
the user name for the current pid will be determined from the password
file and this environment variable will be set.  Failing that it will
not be set.

=item B<XDG_DATA_HOME>

Specifies the user XDG data directory.  When unspecified, defaults to
F<$HOME/.local/share> in accordance with XDG specifications.
B<xde-chooser> uses this directory to determine the list of default data
directories to search.

=item B<XDG_DATA_DIRS>

Specifies the system XDG data directories.  When unspecified, defaults
to F</usr/local/share:/usr/share> in accordance with XDG specifications.
The directory F</usr/share/xde> will be prefixed to the path unless the
directory is already a component of the path.
B<xde-chooser> uses these directories to determine the list of default
data directories to search.

=item B<XDG_CONFIG_HOME>

Specifies the user XDG configuration directory.  When unspecified,
defaults to F<~/.config> in accordance wtih XDG specifications.
B<xde-chooser> uses this directory to find its configuration files that
are located under F<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xde>.

=item B<XDG_CONFIG_DIRS>

Specifies the system XDG configuration directory.  When unspecified,
defaults to F</etc/xdg> in accordance with XDG specifications.
The directory F</etc/xdg/xde> will be prefixed to the path unless the
directory is already a component of the path.
B<xde-chooser> uses these directories to determine the list of default
configuration directories to search.

=back

=head1 USAGE

B<xde-chooser> is meant to be called directly from an F<~/.xinitrc>
file, or from a display manager such as L<slim(1)>.

=head1 BUGS

B<xde-chooser> should really output the path to the F<XSessions> file
instead of the lowercase session name.

Please report bugs for current versions to the source code repository at
L<https://github.com/bbidulock/xde-session/issues>.

=head1 HISTORY

I wrote B<xde-chooser> to provide a mechanism for selecting available
window managers in an XDG compliant way for the I<unexicon> desktop.
With L<gdm(1)> going to GTK3, the I<unexicon> desktop uses L<xdm(8)>,
L<slim(1)>, L<xde-chooser(1)> and L<xde-session(1)> instead.

B<xde-chooser> was originally written as a gtk-perl program;
however, I hate to wait on computers so it was converted to C<C>.
