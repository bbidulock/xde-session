- [ ] do not autostart tray icons; make an xde-trayicons instead (or
      maybe just use xde-tray) that is autostarted, but which will only
      launch the tray icons requested by the user (or default to a
      reasonable set).

- [ ] Expect system tray .desktop files to be in the XDG subdirectory
      $XDG_DATA_DIRS/trayicons.  Also consider .desktop files with the
      Category of TrayIcon in $XDG_DATA_DIRS/applications.

- [ ] xde-tray (or xde-trayicons) should also monitor the system tray
      and add to configuration tray icons that are launched separately
      after startup.  Should also do X11 Session Management for the
      system tray and icons.

- [ ] do not autostart dock apps; make an xde-dockapps instead (or maybe
      just use xde-dock) that is autostarted, but which will only launch
      the dock apps requested by the user (or default to a reasonable
      set).

- [ ] Expect dock app .desktop files to be in the XDG subdirectory
      $XDG_DATA_DIRS/dockapps.  Also consider .desktop files with the
      Category of DockApp in $XDG_DATA_DIRS/applications.

- [ ] xde-dock (or xde-dockapps) should also monitor the dock and add to
      configuration dock apps that are launched separately after
      startup.  Should also do X11 Session Management for the dock and
      dock apps.
